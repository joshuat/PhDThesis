The \gls{caes} at the University of Melbourne is an ongoing project that aims to develop a source capable of achieving the `holy grail' of scientific imaging, the molecular movie~\cite{dwyer_femtosecond_2006}.
A \gls{caes} also has potential applications with \gls{fib} techniques~\cite{mcclelland_bright_2016} and as particle source for accelerators such as synchrotrons and \glspl{xfel} for \gls{cdi} of non-crystalline targets~\cite{van_oudheusden_electron_2007, zhu_future_2015, mcculloch_cold_2016}.

Some kind of introduction for everything will go here.

Motivate CAES. Imaging of things is important. Membrane proteins, cystallisation. What else can we image with it? What else can we study with it? Ion source.

Briefly motivate part 1 and part 2.}
