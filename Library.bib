The development of techniques to reverse space–charge-driven expansion, or to observe shock waves and other striking phenomena, have been limited by the masking effect of thermal diffusion. Here we show that ultracold ion bunches extracted from laser-cooled atoms can be used to observe the effects of self-interactions with unprecedented detail. We generate arrays of small closely spaced ion bunches that interact to form complex and surprising patterns. We also show that nanosecond cold ion bunches provide data for analogous ultrafast electron systems, where the dynamics occur on timescales too short for detailed observation. In a surprising twist, slow atoms may underpin progress in high-energy and ultrafast physics.},

In polarization spectroscopy a weak probe beam analyses the birefringence induced in a sample by a strong counter progagating cirularly polarized pump beam. The signal is in the form of a dispersion curve. We outline a numerical treatment of optical pumping and use it to make predictions about the general form of polarization spectra in alkali-mela atoms. Theoretical spectra for the D2 transtions in Rb and Cs are generated. Comparison of experiments conducted with diode lasers in room temperature vapours and theory demonstrates that the model accurately reproduces spectra of tansitions from the upper hyperfine level of the ground state. Among these, the close transition F -{\textgreater} F' = F+1 dominates. The polarization spectrum provides an ideal reference, or "error" signal for frequency stabilization of a laser.},

Nearly all examples of these techniques have focused on transmission geometry, restricting the samples and reciprocal spaces that can be investigated. We report a lensless X-ray technique developed for imaging in Bragg and small-angle scattering geometries, which may also find application in transmission geometries. We demonstrate this by imaging a nanofabricated pseudorandom binary structure in small-angle reflection geometry. The technique can be used with extended objects, places no restriction on sample size, and requires no additional sample masking. The realization of X-ray lensless imaging in reflection geometry opens up the possibility of single-shot imaging of surfaces in thin films, buried interfaces in magnetic multilayers, organic photovoltaic and field-effect transistor devices, or Bragg planes in a single crystal.

2  107 A m2 sr1 eV1 and an energy spread less than 0.34 eV. The model is also combined with
Monte-Carlo simulations of the inter-ion Coulomb forces to show that the source can be operated at
several picoamperes with a brightness above 1  107 A m2 sr1 eV1

combined with a conventional ion focusing column, an ion source with these properties could focus a

By varying the photoionization wavelength, we change the effective source temperature from 300 K to 10 K, resulting in a concomitant change in the width of the diffraction peaks, which is consistent with independently measured source parameters. This constitutes a direct measurement of the beam coherence of this ultracold source and confirms its suitability for protein crystal diffraction.},

The absorbing gaseous medium considered in this theory is subjected to irradiation by a quasi-running-wave composed of a strong pump field and a weak probe field propagating in opposite directions. Some new interesting results, not predicted by the so-called hole-burning or rate-equation model, are obtained. In particular, the probe-field-transmission peak line shape is found to be markedly different from what is expected according to the rate equations. For finite Doppler widths and a strong saturating pump field, absorption of the probe field can even change sign, and amplification of this field can actually occur. All these features are explained by a close inspection of the evolution of each atomic ensemble of given velocity. Detailed comparison with similar phenomena already observed in rf experiments is presented and permits us to clarify the new predicted effects.},

By placing a movable mask in front of a double-slit to control the transmission through the individual slits, probability distributions for single- and double-slit arrangements were observed. Also, by recording single electron detection events diffracting through a double-slit, a diffraction pattern was built up from individual events.},

	abstract = {X-ray sources are developing rapidly and their coherent output is growing correspondingly. The increased coherent flux from modern X-ray sources is being matched with an associated development in experimental methods. This article reviews the literature describing the ideas that utilize the increased brilliance from modern X-ray sources. It explores how ideas in coherent X-ray science are leading to developments in other areas, and vice versa. The article describes measurements of coherence properties and uses this discussion as a base from which to describe partially coherent diffraction and X-ray phase-contrast imaging, with applications in materials science, engineering and medicine. Coherent diffraction imaging methods are reviewed along with associated experiments in materials science. Proposals for experiments to be performed with the new X-ray free-electron lasers are briefly discussed. The literature on X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy is described and the features it has in common with other coherent X-ray methods are identified. Many of the ideas used in the coherent X-ray literature have their origins in the optical and electron communities and these connections are explored. A review of the areas in which ideas from coherent X-ray methods are contributing to methods for the neutron, electron and optical communities is presented.},

The acceleration of the atom laser beam can be controlled by compensating the gravitational acceleration and we reach residual accelerations as low as 0.0027 g. The outcoupling mechanism allows for the production of a constant flux of 4.5×10 6 atoms per second and due to transverse guiding we obtain an upper limit for the mean beam width of 4.6 {\textbackslash}mu m. The transverse velocity spread is only 0.2 mm/s and thus an upper limit for the beam quality parameter is M 2 =2.5. We demonstrate the potential of the long interrogation times available with this atom laser beam by measuring the trap frequency in a single measurement. The small beam width together with the long evolution and interrogation time makes this atom laser beam a promising tool for continuous interferometric measurements.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {It is shown that the transverse inhomogeneity of a strong   electromagnetic beam can exert a strong effect on the electrons and   atoms of a medium. Thus, if the frequency exceeds the natural frequency   of the electron oscillations (in a plasma or in atoms), then the   electrons or atoms will be forced out of the beam field. At   subresonance frequencies, the particles will be pulled in, the force   being especially large at resonance. It is noted that this effect can   create either a rarefaction or a compression in the beam and at the   focus of the radiation, maintain a pressure gradient near an opening   from an evacuated vessel to the atmosphere, and create a channel for   the passage of charged particles in the medium. It is shown that the   strong thermal ionizing and separating effects of the ray on the medium   can be used to set up waveguide propagation conditions and to eliminate   divergence of the beam (self-focusing). It is noted that hollow beams   can give rise to directional flow and ejection of the plasma along the   beam axis for plasma transport and creation of plasma current   conductors. The possibilities of accelerating and heating plasma   electrons by a modulated beam are indicated.},

	abstract = {The development of X-ray and electron diffraction methods with ultrahigh time resolution has made it possible to map directly, at the atomic level, structural changes in solids induced by laser excitation. This has resulted in unprecedented insights into the lattice dynamics of solids undergoing phase transitions. In aluminium, for example, femtosecond optical excitation hardly affects the potential energy surface of the lattice; instead, melting of the material is governed by the transfer of thermal energy between the excited electrons and the initially cold lattice. In semiconductors, in contrast, exciting 10 per cent of the valence electrons results in non-thermal lattice collapse owing to the antibonding character of the conduction band. These different material responses raise the intriguing question of how Peierls-distorted systems such as bismuth will respond to strong excitations. The evolution of the atomic configuration of bismuth upon excitation of its A1g lattice mode, which involves damped oscillations of atoms along the direction of the Peierls distortion of the crystal, has been probed, but the actual melting of the material has not yet been investigated. Here we present a femtosecond electron diffraction study of the structural changes in crystalline bismuth as it undergoes laser-induced melting. We find that the dynamics of the phase transition depend strongly on the excitation intensity, with melting occurring within 190 fs (that is, within half a period of the unperturbed A1g lattice mode) at the highest excitation. We attribute the surprising speed of the melting process to laser-induced changes in the potential energy surface of the lattice, which result in strong acceleration of the atoms along the longitudinal direction of the lattice and efficient coupling of this motion to an unstable transverse vibrational mode. That is, the atomic motions in crystalline bismuth can be electronically accelerated so that the solid-to-liquid phase transition occurs on a sub-vibrational timescale.},

	abstract = {Cold atom electron and ion sources produce electron bunches and ion beams by photoionization of laser-cooled atoms. They offer high coherence and the potential for high brightness, with applications including ultra-fast electron-diffractive imaging of dynamic processes at the nanoscale. The effective brightness of electron sources has been limited by nonlinear divergence caused by repulsive interactions between the electrons, known as the Coulomb explosion. It has been shown that electron bunches with ellipsoidal shape and uniform density distribution have linear internal Coulomb fields, such that the Coulomb explosion can be reversed using conventional optics. Our source can create bunches shaped in three dimensions and hence in principle achieve the transverse spatial coherence and brightness needed for picosecond-diffractive imaging with nanometer resolution. Here we present results showing how the shaping capability can be used to measure the spatial coherence properties of the cold electron source. We also investigate space-charge effects with ions and generate electron bunches with durations of a few hundred picoseconds. Future development of the cold atom electron and ion source will increase the bunch charge and charge density, demonstrate reversal of Coulomb explosion, and ultimately, ultra-fast coherent electron-diffractive imaging.},

	abstract = {The authors describe a new method for creating a high quality focused ion beam using laser-cooled neutral atoms in a magneto-optical trap as an ion source. They show that this new technique can provide spot resolutions and brightness values that are better than the state of the art in focused ion beams. The source can be used with a range of different ionic species and can be combined with laser cooling techniques to exert unprecedented control over the ion emission, for example, producing single ions “on demand.” The beam quality is a result of a high brightness and a narrow energy distribution, both of which stem from the cold temperature ( ≈ 100 μK) of the atoms. The ions are produced by subjecting the cold neutral atoms to a photoionization laser, after which they become a compact source of nearly monoenergetic ions. With the application of a potential gradient, the ions form a beam that can be focused via standard ion optical techniques. They discuss estimations based on the initial size of the ion cloud and the energy distribution and show that the resulting beam has a low emittance.},

The heating elements and thermocouples are external to the vacuum, protecting them from the hostile hot alkali environment and allowing repair without breaking vacuum. The thermal source is followed by a Zeeman slower with a single-layer coil of variable winding pitch. The single-layer design is simple to construct and has low inductance which allows for rapid switching of the magnetic field. The coil pitch was determined by fitting the analytic form of the magnetic field for a variable winding pitch to the desired magnetic field profile required to slow atoms. The measured magnetic field for the constructed coil is in excellent agreement with the desired field. The source produces atoms at 35 m/s with a flux up to 2 x 10(10) cm(-2) s(-1) at 200 degrees C.},

While much has been achieved thanks to modern ultrafast laser technology, the ultimate coherent light source, the X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL), promises to deliver the highest X-ray photon flux in the shortest pulses at energies unreachable by conventional solid-state lasers. In parallel, other approaches that utilize electrons in table-top setups as a probe have been developed demonstrating the potential for a valid complement to X-ray based techniques. Here, we consider yet another possible avenue in which the technology of electron diffraction and imaging is pushed further; we estimate the interest and performances of a femtosecond high energy electron microscope and propose a hybrid experiment with relativistic electrons as a probe and fs X-ray pulses as a pump taking advantage of both technologies.},

Delay time ( t d ) measurements have shown that the experimental value of t d is almost three orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical value, calculated in a simple electrothermal model. This suggests that under non-equilibrium conditions (in high electric fields) electron correlation effects contribute to the development of the insulator to metal transition. The extra-carrier injection from Si into VO 2 was carried out in the structures Si-SiO 2 -VO 2 on p-type silicon with ρ = 0.1 Ω cm and a SiO 2 thickness 70 nm. It has been shown that the metal-insulator transition in VO 2 can be initiated by injection, i.e. by the increase of the electron density. The value of the critical density was found to be of the order of the electron density in VO 2 in the semiconducting phase, approximately 10 18 -10 19 cm -3 . This confirms that the metal-insulator transition in VO 2 is the purely electronic Mott-Hubbard transition.},

	abstract = {Modern nanotechnology tools allowed us to prepare slits of 90 nm width and 450 nm spacing in a screen almost completely opaque to 200 keV electrons. Then by covering both slits with a layer of amorphous material and carrying out the experiment in a conventional transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy filter we can demonstrate that the diffraction pattern, taken by selecting the elastically scattered electrons, shows the presence of interference fringes, but with a bimodal envelope which can be accounted for by taking into account the non-constant thickness of the deposited layer. However, the intensity of the inelastically scattered electrons in the diffraction plane is very broad and at the limit of detectability. Therefore the experiment was repeated using an aluminum film and a microscope also equipped with a Schottky field emission gun. It was thus possible to observe also the image due to the inelastically scattered electron, which does not show interference phenomena both in the Fraunhofer or Fresnel regimes. If we assume that inelastic scattering through the thin layer covering the slits provides the dissipative process of interaction responsible for the localization mechanism, then these experiments can be considered a variant of the Feynman which-way thought experiment.

In this review we discuss the basic physics and application of Mott polarimetry. A number of different Mott polarimeter designs are described that illustrate the wide range of operating energies (10 eV–1 MeV) and geometries that can be used in such instruments. The calibration of Mott polarimeters is discussed together with the potential sources of systematic error that can arise and that can limit measurement accuracies. The aim is to present a comprehensive practical guide to Mott polarimetry and the capabilities of the technique.},

Since the ions gain a large amount of kinetic energy while building up negative potential energy, plasmas are usually heated to a moderately coupled state that is almost independent of the initial temperature. We show how this process is related to the establishment of Coulomb structure in the final plasma state. Several possibilities for reducing the heating by the introduction of structure in the initial state, i.e., the gas before ionization, are then discussed. (© 2003 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co.

The anti-influenza virus drug amantadine hydrochloride significantly attenuated the inward current induced by hyperpolarization of oocyte membranes. Mutations in the M2 membrane-spanning domain that confer viral resistance to amantadine produced currents that were resistant to the drug. Analysis of the currents of these altered M2 proteins suggests that the channel pore is formed by the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein. The wild-type M2 channel was found to be regulated by pH.

Using this technique, we demonstrate frequency locking of a diode laser to the 5 2S1/2 (F = 2) → 52P3/2 (F′ = 3) transition of 87Rb. The frequency fluctuations and the drift were measured to be less than 0.3 MHz and 0.05 MHz, respectively, for observation period of more than 3 h.

	abstract = {External control of the conductivity of correlated oxides is one of the most promising schemes for realizing energy-efficient electronic devices. Vanadium dioxide (VO2), an archetypal correlated oxide compound, undergoes a temperature-driven metal–insulator transition near room temperature with a concomitant change in crystal symmetry. Here, we show that the metal–insulator transition temperature of thin VO2(001) films can be changed continuously from {\textasciitilde}285 to {\textasciitilde}345 K by varying the thickness of the RuO2 buffer layer (resulting in different epitaxial strains). Using strain-, polarization- and temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and electronic transport measurements, we demonstrate that the transition temperature and the structural distortion across the transition depend on the orbital occupancy in the metallic state. Our findings open up the possibility of controlling the conductivity in atomically thin VO2 layers by manipulating the orbital occupancy by, for example, heterostructural engineering.

In contrast to most other work on polarization spectroscopy, we use a polarization beam splitting cube and two detectors (rather than a polarizer and one detector) to analyse the probe beam. The signal is in the form of a derivative of a Lorentzian. For theoretical analysis we study the closed atomic transition 5 2S1/2 (F = 3) → 5 2P3/2 (F' = 4) in the D2 line of 85Rb. We study the time needed to redistribute population among the mF states, derive an expression for the expected lineshape and present experimental data in excellent agreement with theory. The polarization spectrum provides an ideal error signal for frequency stabilization of a laser. We describe the geometry and parameters for optimizing the error signal.},

It is shown that all three methods are equivalent, in contrast with previously reported difficulties in obtaining consistency in the phase. Each method is illustrated by calculating the Rabi frequencies for each hyperfine transition in a n2S1/2-n'2q3/2 manifold. The importance of consistency in the ordering of the quantum numbers in matrix elements of operator components is discussed.},

The Shannon sampling, defined by the transform of the periodically repeated autocorrelation of the object, is related to Bragg scattering from an equivalent crystal, and shown to be consistent with the sampling of Young's fringes established by scattering from extreme points in the object.

Because of their short mean free path, electrons are particularly well suited for investigating surfaces and thin films, such as the challenging and important class of membrane proteins. To perform single-shot diffraction experiments on protein crystals, an ultracold electron source was proposed, based on near-threshold photoionization of laser-cooled atoms, which is capable of producing electron pulses of both high intensity and high coherence. Here we show that high coherence electron pulses can be produced by femtosecond photoionization, opening up a new regime of ultrafast structural dynamics experiments. The transverse coherence turns out to be much better than expected on the basis of the large bandwidth of the femtosecond ionization laser pulses. This surprising result can be explained by analysis of classical electron trajectories.},

	abstract = {We examine several approaches to laser frequency noise measurement in the frequency and time domains. Commonly employed methods such as optical frequency discrimination and the Allan variance are found to be complex, expensive, time-consuming, or incomplete. We describe a practical method of demodulating a laser beat note to measure a frequency noise spectrum, using a phase-locked loop frequency discriminator based on a single low-cost integrated circuit. This method measures the frequency noise spectrum of a laser directly and in detail and is insensitive to intensity fluctuations. The advantages of this scheme are demonstrated through measurement of the frequency noise spectrum for two external cavity diode lasers (ECDL), clearly distinguishing several common noise sources. These are isolated and removed, reducing the individual laser rms linewidth from 2 MHz to 450 kHz. The spectrum is used to calculate the Allan variance, which shows almost none of the important information.},

	abstract = {The measurement of emittance in space-charge dominated, high brightness beam systems is investigated from conceptual, computational, and experimental viewpoints. As the self-field-induced collective motion in the low energy, high brightness beams emitted from photoinjector rf guns are more important in determining the macroscopic beam evolution than thermal spreads in transverse velocity; traditional methods for phase space diagnosis fail in these systems. We discuss the role of space charge forces in a traditional measurement of transverse emittance, the quadrupole scan. The mitigation of these effects by use of multislit- or pepper-pot-based techniques is explained. The results of a direct experimental comparison between quadrupole scanning and slit-based determination of the emittance of a 5 MeV high brightness electron beam are presented. These data are interpreted with the aid of both envelope and multiparticle simulation codes. It is shown that the ratio of the beam’s β function to its transverse plasma wavelength plays a central role in the quadrupole scan results. Methods of determining the presence of systematic errors in quadrupole scan data are discussed.},

	abstract = {How to make vanadium dioxide metallic
At about 70°C, the material vanadium dioxide (VO2) switches from being a semiconductor to a metal. The switch happens so fast that it may be useful in electronic devices, but it is not clear whether the switch is primarily caused by enhanced interactions between electrons or by a change in the crystal structure. Morrison et al. shone laser light on a sample of VO2, initially in a semiconducting state. They used electron diffraction to monitor the changes in the material's crystal structure and simultaneously measured its optical properties to monitor the electronic state. For certain laser powers, VO2 switched to a long-lived metallic state even though it preserved its initial crystal structure.
Science, this issue p. 445
The complex interplay among several active degrees of freedom (charge, lattice, orbital, and spin) is thought to determine the electronic properties of many oxides. We report on combined ultrafast electron diffraction and infrared transmissivity experiments in which we directly monitored and separated the lattice and charge density reorganizations that are associated with the optically induced semiconductor-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2). By photoexciting the monoclinic semiconducting phase, we were able to induce a transition to a metastable state that retained the periodic lattice distortion characteristic of the semiconductor but also acquired metal-like mid-infrared optical properties. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast electron diffraction is capable of following details of both lattice and electronic structural dynamics on the ultrafast time scale.
Simultaneous measurements of structural and optical properties are used to study optically excited vanadium dioxide.

For naturally occurring biological material, electrons at present provide the most information for a given amount of radiation damage. Using phase contrast electron microscopy on biological molecules and macromolecular assemblies of approximately 10(5) molecular weight and above, there is in theory enough information present in the image to allow determination of the position and orientation of individual particles: the application of averaging methods can then be used to provide an atomic resolution structure. The images of approximately 10,000 particles are required. Below 10(5) molecular weight, some kind of crystal or other geometrically ordered aggregate is necessary to provide a sufficiently high combined molecular weight to allow for the alignment. In practice, the present quality of the best images still falls short of that attainable in theory and this means that a greater number of particles must be averaged and that the molecular weight limitation is somewhat larger than the predicted limit. For X-rays, the amount of damage per useful elastic scattering event is several hundred times greater than for electrons at all wavelengths and energies and therefore the requirements on specimen size and number of particles are correspondingly larger. Because of the lack of sufficiently bright neutron sources in the foreseeable future, electron microscopy in practice provides the greatest potential for immediate progress.},

We describe the principles underlying the construction and operation of SSC cameras, illustrate them with the particular case of Gatan SSCs, and document the versatility of the camera with several examples. We then describe an SSC-based TEM autotuning procedure which automatically analyzes diffractograms of captured images, and aligns (to the coma-free axis), stigmates, and focuses a high-resolution electron microscope faster and with better precision than even the most skilled human operators.},

Cooling rates of up to ≈300 μK/s are observed without significant atom loss. The final temperature achieved was (a somewhat disappointing) 17 μK. Experimental studies and theoretical analysis of this cooling process were carried out, which explain that the temperature limit is due to an equilibrium between the small fraction of total thermal energy that is removed per Sisyphus cycle and the multiple photon recoils that are required to complete each cycle. Light-induced collisional loss made it difficult to operate under conditions where a larger fraction of the energy would be removed.

	abstract = {There is enormous potential for the discovery of innovative cancer drugs with improved efficacy and selectivity for the third millennium. In this review we show how novel mechanism-based agents are being discovered by focusing on the molecular targets and pathways that are causally involved in cancer formation, maintenance and progression. We also show how new technologies, from genomics through high throughput bioscience, combinatorial chemistry, rational drug design and molecular pharmacodynamic and imaging techniques, are accelerating the pace of cancer drug discovery. The process of contemporary small molecule drug discovery is described and progress and current issues are reviewed. New and potential targets and pathways for therapeutic intervention are illustrated. The first examples of a new generation of molecular therapeutics are now entering hypothesis-testing clinical trials and showing activity. The early years of the new millennium will see a range of exciting new agents moving from bench to bedside and beginning to impact on the management and cure of cancer.},

This elegant technique, whereby atoms, molecules, and even microscopic beads of glass, can be trapped in small regions of free space by beams of light and subsequently moved at will using other beams, has revolutionized many areas of physics. In particular, it provides a useful research tool for the study of individual atoms, for investigating the details of chemical reactions, and even for the study of atomic motion in the quantum domain.This text begins with a review of the relevant aspects of quantum mechanics; it then turns to the electromagnetic interactions involved in slowing and trapping atoms, in both magnetic and optical traps. The concluding chapters discuss a broad range of applications, including atomic clocks, studies of ultra-cold collision processes, diffraction and interference of atomic beams, optical lattices, and Bose-Einstein condensation. The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students who have some basic knowledge of optics and quantum mechanics. An extensive bibliography provides access to the current research literature.},

Nonetheless, they are known to exhibit discrete energy levels due to quantum confinement effects. We show that, like single-atom or single-molecule two- and three-level quantum systems, single semiconductor quantum dots can also exhibit interference phenomena when driven simultaneously by two optical fields. Probe absorption spectra are obtained that exhibit Autler-Townes splitting when the optical fields drive coupled transitions and complex Mollow-related structure, including gain without population inversion, when they drive the same transition. Our results open the way for the demonstration of numerous quantum level–based applications, such as quantum dot lasers, optical modulators, and quantum logic devices.},

	abstract = {Protein characterization plays a role in two key aspects of structural proteomics. The first is the quality assessment of the produced protein preparations. Obtaining well diffracting crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure-determination pipeline. Often, this is caused by the poor quality of the protein preparation used for crystallization trials. Hence, it is essential to perform an extensive quality assessment of the protein preparations prior to crystallization and to use the results in the evaluation of the process. Here, a protein-production and crystallization strategy is proposed with threshold values for protein purity (95\%) and monodispersity (85\%) below which a further optimization of the protein-production process is strongly recommended. The second aspect is the determination of protein characteristics such as domains, oligomeric state, post-translational modifications and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In this paper, applications and new developments of protein-characterization methods using MS, fluorescence spectroscopy, static light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering within the EC Structural Proteomics in Europe contract are described. Examples of the application of the various methods are given.},

We use an approach of the Weisskopf-Wigner type to investigate the interaction of the dressed states of the atom-driving field system to the surrouding environment, and calculate the linewidth of the resonance fluorescence spectrum in terms of the decay rate of the dressed coherences. Unlike the conventional theory, we deal first with the exact interaction of the atom with the driving laser field, and then consider the coupling of this combined system to the modes of the environment within the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. This modification of the traditional sequence in which the interactions are handled leads to a sensitive dependence of the fluorescence spectrum on the density of modes and suggests that a driven atom placed in a suitable environment, such as for example a high-Q resonator, even if Markovian, might behave quite differently from an identical system in free space. The significance of this effect is shown explicitly for the case of a strongly driven two level atom in an environment with a modal density which is substantially frequency dependent on the scale of the Rabi frequency of the driving laser field.},

The joint atomic-scale resolutions in space and time, and sensitivity reached, make it possible to determine complex transient structures and assemblies in different phases. These applications include studies of isolated chemical reactions (molecular beams), interfaces, surfaces and nanocrystals, self-assembly, and 2D crystalline fatty-acid bilayers. In 4D UEM, we are now able, using timed, single-electron packets, to image nano-to-micro scale structures of materials and biological cells. Future applications of these methods are foreseen across areas of physics, chemistry, and biology.},

	abstract = {Correlated electron materials can undergo a variety of phase transitions, including superconductivity, the metal–insulator transition and colossal magnetoresistance. Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO2. Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO2 by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341 K in VO2, but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO2 with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.},

	abstract = {Electron diffraction from metalcoated freestanding nanofabricated gratings is presented, with a quantitative path integral analysis of the electron-grating interactions. Electron diffraction out to the 20th order was observed indicating the high quality of our nanofabricated gratings. The electron beam is collimated to its diffraction limit with ion-milled material slits. Our path integral analysis is first tested against single slit electron diffraction, and then further expanded with the same theoretical approach to describe gratingdiffraction. Rotation of the grating with respect to the incident electron beam varies the effective distance between the electron and grating bars. This allows the measurement of the image charge potential between the electron and the grating bars. Image charge potentials that were about 15\% of the value for that of a pure electron-metal wall interaction were found. We varied the electron energy from 50 to 900 eV . The interaction time is of the order of typical metal image charge response times and in principle allows the investigation of image charge formation. In addition to the image charge interaction there is a dephasing process reducing the transverse coherence length of the electron wave. The dephasing process causes broadening of the diffraction peaks and is consistent with a model that ascribes the dephasing process to microscopic contact potentials. Surface structures with length scales of about 200 nm observed with a scanning tunneling microscope, and dephasing interaction strength typical of contact potentials of 0.35 eV support this claim. Such a dephasing model motivated the investigation of different metallic coatings, in particular Ni, Ti, Al, and different thickness Au–Pd coatings. Improved quality of diffraction patterns was found for Ni. This coating made electron diffraction possible at energies as low as 50 eV . This energy was limited by our electron gun design. These results are particularly relevant for the use of these gratings as coherent beam splitters in low energy electron interferometry.},

The loading is a dynamical process determined by a loading rate and a density dependent loss rate. The loading rate depends on cooling and the flux of atoms into the trapping volume, and the loss rate is due to excited state collisions induced by the MOT light fields. From this study we found ways to optimize the loading of the optical dipole trap. Key ingredients for maximum loading are found to be a reduction of the hyperfine repump intensity, increased detuning of the MOT light, and a displacement of the optical dipole trap center with respect to the MOT. A factor of 2 increase in the number of loaded atoms is demonstrated by using a hyperfine repump beam with a shadow in it. In this way we load 8×10685Rb atoms into a 1 mK deep optical dipole trap with a waist of 58 {\textbackslash}mu m, which is 40\% of the atoms initially trapped in the MOT.},

This new imaging scheme could be extended to other impurities such as ions, and is ideally suited to equilibrium and dynamical studies of complex many-body phenomena involving strongly interacting particles.

	abstract = {Ultrafast electron diffraction enables the study of molecular structural dynamics with atomic resolution at subpicosecond timescales, with applications in solid-state physics and rational drug design. Progress with ultrafast electron diffraction has been constrained by the limited transverse coherence of high-current electron sources. Photoionization of laser-cooled atoms can produce electrons of intrinsically high coherence, but has been too slow for ultrafast electron diffraction. Ionization with femtosecond lasers should in principle reduce the electron pulse duration, but the high bandwidth inherent to short laser pulses is expected to destroy the transverse coherence. Here we demonstrate that a two-colour process with femtosecond excitation followed by nanosecond photoionization can produce picosecond electron bunches with high transverse coherence. Ultimately, the unique combination of ultrafast ionization, high coherence and three-dimensional bunch shaping capabilities of cold atom electron sources have the potential for realising the brightness and coherence requirements for single-shot electron diffraction from crystalline biological samples.

At present, significant disagreement exists regarding features of the disordered Bose–Hubbard model, which is used to study disorder in strongly correlated bosonic systems. Here, by measuring transport in a disordered optical lattice, we discover a disorder-induced superfluid-to-insulator transition in this system, in quantitative agreement with a predicted superfluid–Bose-glass transition from recent numerical simulations. Both the superfluid-to-insulator transition and correlated changes in the atomic quasimomentum distribution—which verify a simple model for the interplay of disorder and interactions in this system—are phenomena new to the unit-filling regime explored in this work. We find that increasing disorder strength generically leads to greater dissipation, excluding predictions of a disorder-induced or ‘re-entrant’ superfluid. Whereas the absence of a re-entrant superfluid may be explained by finite temperature, the measured bounds on entropy strongly constrain theory.},

A minimally destructive, quantitative and high-resolution image of the atom cloud column density is then retrieved from a single diffraction pattern.},

Here we numerically investigate the performance of an ultracold ion source which has the potential for generating ion beams which combine high brightness with small energy spread. The source is based on creating very cold ion beams by near-threshold photoionization of a laser-cooled and trapped atomic gas. We present ab initio numerical calculations of the generation of ultracold beams in a realistic acceleration field and including all Coulomb interactions, i.e., both space charge effects and statistical Coulomb effects. These simulations demonstrate that with existing technology reduced brightness values exceeding 105 A m−2 sr−1 V−1 are feasible at an energy spread as low as 0.1 eV. The estimated spot size of the ultracold ion source in a FIB instrument ranges from 10 nm at a current of 100 pA to 0.8 nm at 1 pA.},

MS is used routinely for the determination of the total mass of proteins, including N-glycosylated proteins, analysis of selenomethionine incorporation, crystal content verification, and analysis of N-glycosylation site occupancy. Protocols for sample preparation, data collection, and analysis are given.A recent development is the fluorescence-based thermal shift (ThermoFluor) assay. It uses an environmentally sensitive dye, Sypro Orange, to monitor the thermal stability of a protein and investigate factors (e.g., buffers, additives, and ligands) affecting this stability. This chapter describes the application of this method using a 96-condition in-house screen. The measurements are performed on a commercially available real-time PCR machine. Multiangle or static light scattering (SLS) is a very powerful technique to determine the conformational state of proteins in solution, especially when used in combination with size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In the authors' experimental set-up the SLS detector is connected in-line to a standard protein purification machine (e.g., the Akta Purifier) equipped with an analytical SEC column. The data collection and analysis are performed using commercial software.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08958},
	abstract = {Imaging a single protein has been a long-standing dream for advancing structural biology and with this various fields in natural science. In particular, revealing the distinct conformations of an individual protein is of outermost importance. To do so, one needs to master and combine three requirements. At first, a method for isolating individual proteins for further inspection has to be at hand; quite the opposite to the current challenge of assembling proteins into a crystal for X-ray analysis. Furthermore, technologies are required for keeping a single protein fixed in space long enough to accumulate sufficient structural information from a scattering experiment. Last but not least, gentle radiation with a wavelength small enough to uncover structural details while ensuring that radiation damage does not decompose the protein during observation as it is available by low-energy electron holography is vital for imaging. Here we show that soft-landing electrospray beam deposition allows for specific selection and sound deposition of individual proteins and protein complexes onto ultraclean freestanding graphene in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Due to the fact that graphene is transparent for low-energy electrons and since the latter do not damage biological molecules, we were able to acquire high signal-to-noise ratio electron holograms of individual proteins (Cytochrome C and BSA) as well as of protein complexes (haemoglobin). The numerical hologram reconstructions reveal the overall shape of single proteins. With this, images of individual folded proteins and protein complexes, not being the result of an averaging process, have been obtained for the first time.},

Due to light-induced two-body collisions during the loading stage of the trap the maximum number of captured atoms is locked to one. This collisional blockade effect is confirmed by the observation of photon antibunching in the detected fluorescence light. The spectral properties of single photons emitted by the atom were studied with a narrow-band scanning cavity. We find that the atomic fluorescence spectrum is dominated by the spectral width of the exciting laser light field. In addition we observe a spectral broadening of the atomic fluorescence light due to the Doppler effect. This allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the trapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 μK. This simple single-atom trap is the key element for the generation of atom-photon entanglement required for future applications in quantum communication and a first loophole-free test of Bell’s inequality.},

The time for a trapped atom to scatter one photon off the trapping beam is measured and found to be linear in the trapping laser detuning. At a detuning of 0.5 nm from resonance this time was measured to be ∼100 msec, indicating that the atoms are exposed on average only to ∼1/700 of the maximal light intensity in the trap.

Using this scheme, we show that Bose-Einstein condensation with ∼105 cesium atoms can be realized in 2–4 s of forced evaporation.

A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns.

	abstract = {Continuous wave extended cavity diode lasers are used to measure the absorptive and dispersive properties of the 5 2S1/2 → 5 2P3/2 resonance, at 780 nm, in Rubidium (Rb) vapour. The Doppler-broadened hyperfine transitions are studied both with and without a pump beam. The investigation concentrates on three-level Λ-systems, realized in the presence of a pump beam, exhibiting Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) is also seen. The EIT and EIA resonances can be several orders of magnitude narrower than the natural line width of the atomic transitions in the absence of the pump beam. Further, the EIT resonances are sensitive to applied magnetic fields.
The narrowest resonances measured in this work have a full-width at halfmaximum of ∼ 80 kHz. This is limited by the transit time of the atoms through
the probe and pump beams.
Predictions of theoretical calculations and models are compared to experimental
results. The theory of beam splitters and interferometers is developed to enable
the implementation of a Sagnac interferometer in a novel “biased” alignment.
This allows the dispersion of atomic resonances to be measured directly.
The direct measurement of the dispersion of the narrow EIT features in a “biased”
Sagnac interferometer is presented. Such a signal is ideally suited to
precision measurement applications such as inertial sensing and magnetometry},

Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation3, 4, 5 suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12 keV energy or 1 Å wavelength2) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers6, 7 that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

	abstract = {Using two crossed 1064-nm optical-dipole-trap lasers to be the Raman beams, an effective vector gauge potential for Bose-Einstein condensed 87Rb in the F=2 hyperfine ground state is experimentally created. The moderate strength of the Raman coupling still can be achieved when the detuning from atomic resonance is larger than the excited-state fine structure, since rubidium has 15 nm energy-level spitting. The atoms at the far detuning of the Raman coupling are loaded adiabatically into the dressed states by ramping the homogeneous bias magnetic field with different paths and the dressed states with different energies are studied experimentally. The experimental scheme can be easily extended to produce the synthetic magnetic or electric field by means of a spatial or time dependence of the effective vector potential.},

	abstract = {Femtosecond electron diffraction (FED) has the potential to directly observe transition state processes. The relevant motions for this barrier-crossing event occur on the hundred femtosecond time-scale. Recent advances in the development of high-flux electron pulse sources with the required time resolution and sensitivity to capture barrier-crossing processes are described in the context of attaining atomic level details of such structural dynamics—seeing chemical events as they occur. Initial work focused on the ordered-to-disordered phase transition of Al under strong driving conditions for which melting takes on nm or molecular scale dimensions. This work has been extended to Au, which clearly shows a separation in time-scales for lattice heating and melting. It also demonstrates that superheated face-centred cubic (FCC) metals melt through thermal mechanisms involving homogeneous nucleation to propagate the disordering process. A new concept exploiting electron–electron correlation is introduced for pulse characterization and determination of t=0 to within 100 fs as well as for spatial manipulation of the electron beam. Laser-based methods are shown to provide further improvements in time resolution with respect to pulse characterization, absolute t=0 determination, and the potential for electron acceleration to energies optimal for time-resolved diffraction.},

In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

Recently, a new type of FIB source has emerged, which uses ionization of laser cooled neutral atoms to produce the ion beam. The extremely cold temperatures attainable with laser cooling (in the range of 100 μK or below) result in a beam of ions with a very small transverse velocity distribution. This corresponds to a source with extremely high brightness that rivals or may even exceed the brightness of the industry standard Ga+ liquid metal ion source. In this review, we discuss the context of ion beam technology in which these new ion sources can play a role, their principles of operation, and some examples of recent demonstrations. The field is relatively new, so only a few applications have been demonstrated, most notably low energy ion microscopy with Li ions. Nevertheless, a number of promising new approaches have been proposed and/or demonstrated, suggesting that a rapid evolution of this type of source is likely in the near future.},

	title = {Use of an {Optical} dipole {Trap} in a {Cold}-atom {Electron} {Source}},
	abstract = {The University of Melbourne’s cold-atom electron source (CAES) project aims to
create short, high-brightness, high-coherence electron bunches for use in ultra-fast,
single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). The imaging of nanoscale objects such as
biological molecules and defects in solid-state devices by ultrafast, single-shot electron
diffractive imaging would provide important information about structure and dynamic
processes. If the CAES is successful then it will be able to determine the structure
of essential molecules, such as membrane proteins, and create ‘molecular movies’ of
chemical reactions.
The CAES operates by ionising rubidium-85 atoms that have been cooled and
trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). This ionisation is a two-stage process that
produces extremely cold electron bunches (T = 10 K) which are accelerated towards
the sample under investigation. During ionisation the trapping must be turned off.
This causes the atom cloud to expand and residual magnetic fields interfere with the
trajectories of the electron bunches.
An optical dipole trap (ODT) has been designed, constructed and integrated with
the CAES during the course of this project. The ODT stabilises the trajectories of
the electron bunches which is essential for imaging. The ODT consists of two 700 mW
Gaussian laser beams whose foci overlap with each other and the MOT atom cloud.
Atoms feel a force towards the high intensity regions of the ODT beams, such as the
foci. This serves to trap the atoms and is used to hold the atoms in place while the
residual magnetic fields from the MOT dissipate and thus produce electron bunches
free from magnetic disturbance.},

	abstract = {Since the first observation of electron diffraction in 1927, electrons have been used to probe the structure of matter. High-brightness sources of thermal electrons have recently emerged that are capable of simultaneously providing high spatial resolving power along with ultrafast temporal resolution, however they are yet to demonstrate the holy grail of single-shot diffraction of non-crystalline objects. The development of the cold atom electron source, based around the ionisation of laser cooled atoms, has the potential to contribute to this goal. Electron generation from laser cooled atoms is in its infancy, but in just ten years has moved from a proposal to a source capable of performing single-shot diffraction imaging of crystalline structures. The high brightness, high transverse coherence length, and small energy spread of cold electron sources are also potentially advantageous for applications ranging from seeding of x-ray free-electron lasers and synchrotrons to coherent diffractive imaging and microscopy. In this review we discuss the context which motivates the development of these sources, the operating principles of the source, and recent experimental results. The achievements demonstrated thus far combined with theoretical proposals to alleviate current bottlenecks in development promise a bright future for these sources.},

We present a novel design to reduce this thermal noise limit by an order of magnitude as well as an experimental realization of this new cavity system, demonstrating the most stable oscillator of any kind to date for averaging times of 0.1–10 s. The cavity spacer and the mirror substrates are both constructed from single-crystal silicon and are operated at 124 K, where the silicon thermal expansion coefficient is zero and the mechanical loss is small. The cavity is supported in a vibration-insensitive configuration, which, together with the superior stiffness of the silicon crystal, reduces the vibration-related noise. With rigorous analysis of heterodyne beat signals among three independent stable lasers, the silicon system demonstrates a fractional frequency instability of 1 × 10−16 at short timescales and supports a laser linewidth of {\textless}40 mHz at 1.5 µm.

In this model, electrostatic space-charge forces within a charged particle beam are calculated self-consistently at each time step by solving the three-dimensional Poisson equation in the beam frame and then transforming back to the laboratory frame. When the beam has a large energy spread, it is divided into a number of energy bins or slices so that the space-charge forces are calculated from the contribution of each bin and summed together. Image-charge effects from conducting photocathode are also included efficiently using a shifted-Green function method. For a beam with large aspect ratio, e.g., during emission, an integrated Green function method is used to solve the three-dimensional Poisson equation. Using this model, we studied beam transport in one Linac Coherent Light Sources photoinjector design through the first traveling wave linac with initial misalignment with respect to the accelerating axis.},

	abstract = {One of the great dream experiments in Science is to directly observe atomic motions as they occur. Femtosecond electron diffraction provided the first 'light' of sufficient intensity to achieve this goal by attaining atomic resolution to structural changes on the relevant timescales. This review covers the technical progress that made this new level of acuity possible and gives a survey of the new insights gained from an atomic level perspective of structural dynamics. Atomic level views of the simplest possible structural transition, melting, are discussed for a number of systems in which both thermal and purely electronically driven atomic displacements can be correlated with the degree of directional bonding. Optical manipulation of charge distributions and effects on interatomic forces/bonding can be directly observed through the ensuing atomic motions. New phenomena involving strongly correlated electron–lattice systems are also discussed in which optically induced changes in the potential energy landscape lead to ballistic structural changes. Concepts such as the structural order parameters are now directly observable at the atomic level of inspection to give a remarkable view of the extraordinary degree of cooperativity involved in strongly correlated electron–lattice systems. These recent examples, in combination with time-resolved real space imaging now possible with electron probes, are truly defining an emerging field that holds great promise to make a significant impact in how we understand structural dynamics.

The pulse length has been measured using a resonant 3 GHz deflecting cavity in TM110 mode. We have measured the pulse length in three ionization regimes. The first is direct two-photon photoionization using only a 480 nm femtosecond laser pulse, which results in short (∼15 ps) but hot (∼104 K) electron bunches. The second regime is just-above-threshold femtosecond photoionization employing the combination of a continuous-wave 780 nm excitation laser and a tunable 480 nm femtosecond ionization laser which results in both ultracold (∼10 K) and ultrafast (∼25 ps) electron bunches. These pulses typically contain ∼103 electrons and have a root-mean-square normalized transverse beam emittance of 1.5 ± 0.1 nm rad. The measured pulse lengths are limited by the energy spread associated with the longitudinal size of the ionization volume, as expected. The third regime is just-below-threshold ionization which produces Rydberg states which slowly ionize on microsecond time scales.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed—and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins—they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-ångström limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4.5 ångströms as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 ångströms. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing.},

	abstract = {Control of Coulomb-induced emittance growth in charged particle beams is of critical importance for applications including electron and ion microscopy, injectors for particle accelerators and in ultrafast electron diffraction, where Coulomb effects constrain the temporal and spatial imaging resolution. The development of techniques to prevent space-charge and disorder-induced emittance growth has been limited by the masking effect of thermal diffusion in conventional beams. In this thesis it is shown that ion bunches from a cold-atom electron and ion source can be used to observe the effects of intrabeam Coulomb interactions with unprecedented detail. Experiments are performed using nanosecond-duration cold ion bunches, which provide data for analogous ultrafast electron systems where the dynamics occur on timescales too short for detailed observation.

Cold ion bunches were produced by photoionising a laser-cooled gas. The intensity profile of the photoionising lasers was controlled using a spatial light modulator, which allowed for shaping of the spatial charge density distribution of the ion bunches. Nonlinear space-charge expansion dynamics were observed in the propagation of the ion bunches. Certain aspects of the observed dynamics were inconsistent with initial modelling attempts. In particular, high-density rings were formed in the transverse density distribution, which were not predicted in particle tracking simulations for the calculated initial ion distributions. Through detailed modelling, it was determined that the rings form in the interaction of the expanding ion beam with a diffuse ‘fluorescence halo’ of ions. The fluorescence halos were formed by reabsorption of fluoresced light from the sequential photoexcitation and ionisation process. Modelling of the photoexcitation process and particle-tracking simulations reproduced the experimentally observed beam dynamics, confirming the hypothesis of halo formation. The nonlinear transformation of the beam density profile leading to the formation of the fluorescence halo rings is indicative of loss of beam coherence. The fluorescence halo rings were suppressed by controlling the duration of laser overlap during photoionisation, where a shorter overlap reduces the time available for absorption of fluorescence. Fluorescence halo rings are an issue specific to atomic-gas based sources, but serve as an example of a nonlinear space-charge effect that is observable only because of the non-diffusive cold propagation of the ions. Efforts towards reconstruction of the beam dynamics leading to the ring formation were used to show that the cold ion bunches can be used as a platform to observe space-charge dominated beam dynamics in analogue of high-brightness and ultrafast electron beams.

The cold ion beams were then used as a platform to investigate methods to overcome space-charge-induced beam-quality limitations. Modelling and experimental efforts were contributed to proof-of-principle experiments that demonstrated linearisation of the space-charge effects through beam-shaping. The ion bunches were shaped to uniform transverse distributions to linearise the internal electric field, suppressing the nonlinear space-charge effect. Improvements to the focusing properties of the shaped ion beams were measured, as compared to unshaped bunches, directly demonstrating improvement of beam quality through beam shaping for the first time in any charged particle beam.

Beyond the linearisable space-charge effects are statistical disorder-induced heating (DIH) effects, which set lower-bound achievability limits on particle beam temperature. Models of the DIH process were used to predict the degree to which DIH can be suppressed in cold ion bunches by introducing interparticle spatial correlations in the cold atoms prior to ionisation. Two different methods of introducing correlations were modelled: first, by exploiting the Rydberg blockade effect in the photoexcitation process to excite and ionise atoms with hard-sphere type spatial correlations limited by close-packing effects; and second, by loading the atoms into optical lattices, which have crystalline structural correlations, limited by partial-filling effects. The models predicted that the heating can be significantly suppressed in the cold ion bunches for experimentally achievable degrees of spatial correlation using either of the two correlation methods.

Excitation of Rydberg atoms was implemented in the cold-atom ion source, towards achieving the improvement of beam quality predicted by the DIH modelling. Spectroscopy based on electromagnetically-induced transparency was used to tune photoionising lasers to resonance with Rydberg states. A method was presented for suppressing the formation of fluorescence halos during Rydberg excitation, by using intermediate-state-decoupled stimulated Raman adiabatic passage to excite Rydberg atoms while bypassing population of the fluorescent intermediate state in sequential (ladder) photoexcitation. Measurements of the blockaded photoexcitation dynamics of the Rydberg ion bunches established the presence of spatial correlations, to a degree consistent with a sevenfold increase in beam brightness compared to a disordered distribution, according to the DIH models.

The models, simulations, methods and measurements presented in this thesis guide the development of charged particle beams towards attaining the necessary coherence, focusability, and brightness to perform single-shot ultrafast electron diffraction of biological molecules. In a surprising twist, slow atoms may underpin progress in high energy and ultrafast physics.},

	abstract = {High-resolution X-ray imaging techniques using optical elements such as zone plates are widely used for viewing the internal structure of samples in exquisite detail. The resolution attainable is ultimately limited by the manufacturing tolerances for the optics. Combining ideas from crystallography and holography, this limit may be surpassed by the method of coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). Although CDI shows particular promise in applications involving X-ray free-electron lasers, it is also emerging as an important new technique for imaging at third-generation synchrotrons. The limited coherent output of these sources, however, is a significant barrier to obtaining shorter exposure times. A fundamental assumption of coherent diffractive imaging is that the incident light is well-approximated by a single optical frequency. In this Letter, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of ‘polyCDI’, using a broadband source to achieve a factor of 60 reduction in the exposure time over quasi-monochromatic coherent diffractive imaging.

For beam focusing of the IH-DTL, the method of Alternating-Phase-Focusing (APF) was employed. The compact injector can accelerate heavy ions having a charge-to-mass ratio of qm=13 up to 4.0MeV/u. Use of the APF IH-DTL and operating frequency of 200MHz allowed us to design compact linacs; the total length of the two linacs is less than 6m. Beam-acceleration tests of the compact injector system were performed. The measured intensity of accelerated C4+12 beams with the compact injector was 380eμA. Beam transmission of the APF IH-DTL was estimated to be as high as 96\%, which is comparable to the value calculated by a simulation code. Transverse phase-space and energy distributions of accelerated beams were measured and compared with those calculated by the simulation code, and we found that they were agreed well with each other.},

At present UED experiments are based on femtosecond laser photoemission from solid state cathodes. These photoemission sources perform excellently, but are not sufficiently bright for single-shot studies of, for example, biomolecular samples. We propose a new type of electron source, based on near-threshold photoionization of a laser-cooled and trapped atomic gas. The electron temperature of these sources can be as low as 10 K, implying an increase in brightness by orders of magnitude. We investigate a setup consisting of an ultracold electron source and standard radio-frequency acceleration techniques by GPT tracking simulations. The simulations use realistic fields and include all pairwise Coulomb interactions. We show that in this setup 120 keV, 0.1 pC electron bunches can be produced with a longitudinal emittance sufficiently small for enabling sub-100 fs bunch lengths at 1\% relative energy spread. A transverse root-mean-square normalized emittance of εx = 10 nm is obtained, significantly better than from photoemission sources. Correlations in transverse phase-space indicate that the transverse emittance can be improved even further, enabling single-shot studies of biomolecular samples.},

Recently, a new type of FIB source has emerged, which uses ionization of laser cooled neutral atoms to produce the ion beam. The extremely cold temperatures attainable with laser cooling (in the range of 100 μK or below) result in a beam of ions with a very small transverse velocity distribution. This corresponds to a source with extremely high brightness that rivals or may even exceed the brightness of the industry standard Ga+ liquid metal ion source. In this review, we discuss the context of ion beam technology in which these new ion sources can play a role, their principles of operation, and some examples of recent demonstrations. The field is relatively new, so only a few applications have been demonstrated, most notably low energy ion microscopy with Li ions. Nevertheless, a number of promising new approaches have been proposed and/or demonstrated, suggesting that a rapid evolution of this type of source is likely in the near future.},

	abstract = {A new technique for ultrafast dynamics of surface crystallography was developed by combining reflection high-energy electron diffraction with the electron deflectors of a streak camera system. A one-dimensional distribution of electrons scattered by a crystal surface is selected by a linear slit on a screen, and then the electrons are quickly deflected by the sweep electrodes behind the slit. Thus, a temporal evolution of the one-dimensional diffraction pattern can be displayed as a streak image on a screen. This is a unique method of time-resolved electron diffraction, as a pulsed electron beam is not required to obtain a temporal evolution. The temporal evolution of the diffraction pattern can be projected on a screen from single-shot measurements. The technique was tested on an Si(111)-7×7 surface, and the dynamics of the surface structure were successively obtained from changes in spot intensities. Although the present time time-resolution was limited by the present pumping laser {\textasciitilde}5ns, the nominal resolution of the streak system is expected to be {\textasciitilde}100ps.},

The temperature is determined by electron beam waist scans, source size measurements with ion beams, and analysis with an accurate beam line model. Experimental data is presented for the source temperature as a function of the wavelength of the photoionization laser, for both nanosecond and femtosecond ionization pulses. For the nanosecond laser, temperatures as low as 14±3K were found; for femtosecond photoionization, 30±5K is possible. With a typical source size of 25μm, this results in electron bunches with a relative transverse coherence length in the 10−4 range and an emittance of a few nmrad.},

	abstract = {We present a theoretical description of resonant radiofrequency (RF) deflecting cavities in TM110 mode as dynamic optical elements for ultrafast electron microscopy. We first derive the optical transfer matrix of an ideal pillbox cavity and use a Courant-Snyder formalism to calculate the 6D phase space propagation of a Gaussian electron distribution through the cavity. We derive closed, analytic expressions for the increase in transverse emittance and energy spread of the electron distribution. We demonstrate that for the special case of a beam focused in the center of the cavity, the low emittance and low energy spread of a high quality beam can be maintained, which allows high-repetition rate, ultrafast electron microscopy with 100 fs temporal resolution combined with the atomic resolution of a high-end TEM. This is confirmed by charged particle tracking simulations using a realistic cavity geometry, including fringe fields at the cavity entrance and exit apertures.},
