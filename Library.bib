The deceleration, caused by absorption of counterpropagating resonant laser light, amounts to 40\% of the initial thermal velocity, corresponding to about 15 000 absorptions. Atoms were kept in resonance with the laser by using a spatially varying magnetic field to provide a changing Zeeman shift to compensate for the changing Doppler shift as the atoms decelerated.},

In polarization spectroscopy a weak probe beam analyses the birefringence induced in a sample by a strong counter progagating cirularly polarized pump beam. The signal is in the form of a dispersion curve. We outline a numerical treatment of optical pumping and use it to make predictions about the general form of polarization spectra in alkali-mela atoms. Theoretical spectra for the D2 transtions in Rb and Cs are generated. Comparison of experiments conducted with diode lasers in room temperature vapours and theory demonstrates that the model accurately reproduces spectra of tansitions from the upper hyperfine level of the ground state. Among these, the close transition F -{\textgreater} F' = F+1 dominates. The polarization spectrum provides an ideal reference, or "error" signal for frequency stabilization of a laser.},

We stabilise an external-cavity diode laser near 369 nm for cooling Yb\${\textasciicircum}+\$ ions, using amplitude-modulated polarisation spectroscopy and a commercial PID feedback system. We achieve stable, low-drift locking with a standard deviation of measured laser frequency {\textasciitilde}400 kHz over 10 minutes, limited by the instantaneous linewidth of the diode laser.

	abstract = {Lensless X-ray imaging techniques such as coherent diffraction imaging and ptychography, and Fourier transform holography can provide time-resolved, diffraction-limited images. Nearly all examples of these techniques have focused on transmission geometry, restricting the samples and reciprocal spaces that can be investigated. We report a lensless X-ray technique developed for imaging in Bragg and small-angle scattering geometries, which may also find application in transmission geometries. We demonstrate this by imaging a nanofabricated pseudorandom binary structure in small-angle reflection geometry. The technique can be used with extended objects, places no restriction on sample size, and requires no additional sample masking. The realization of X-ray lensless imaging in reflection geometry opens up the possibility of single-shot imaging of surfaces in thin films, buried interfaces in magnetic multilayers, organic photovoltaic and field-effect transistor devices, or Bragg planes in a single crystal.

	abstract = {A general theory of the saturated-absorption phenomenon in a two-level atomic system is developed, in which the phase relationships between the oscillating atomic dipoles as well as the population differences between energy levels are taken into account. The absorbing gaseous medium considered in this theory is subjected to irradiation by a quasi-running-wave composed of a strong pump field and a weak probe field propagating in opposite directions. Some new interesting results, not predicted by the so-called hole-burning or rate-equation model, are obtained. In particular, the probe-field-transmission peak line shape is found to be markedly different from what is expected according to the rate equations. For finite Doppler widths and a strong saturating pump field, absorption of the probe field can even change sign, and amplification of this field can actually occur. All these features are explained by a close inspection of the evolution of each atomic ensemble of given velocity. Detailed comparison with similar phenomena already observed in rf experiments is presented and permits us to clarify the new predicted effects.},

In 1965, Richard Feynman presented a thought experiment to show these features. Here we demonstrate the full realization of his famous thought experiment. By placing a movable mask in front of a double-slit to control the transmission through the individual slits, probability distributions for single- and double-slit arrangements were observed. Also, by recording single electron detection events diffracting through a double-slit, a diffraction pattern was built up from individual events.},

The signal gradient for these transitions is increased by a factor of 3 and the peak to peak amplitude was increased by a factor of 2. The modulation transfer signal for the 85Rb F=2 to F' transitions is also presented to highlight how this technique can generate a single, clear line for laser frequency stabilization even in cases where there are a number of closely spaced hyperfine transitions.},

The outcoupling mechanism allows for the production of a constant flux of 4.5×10 6 atoms per second and due to transverse guiding we obtain an upper limit for the mean beam width of 4.6 {\textbackslash}mu m. The transverse velocity spread is only 0.2 mm/s and thus an upper limit for the beam quality parameter is M 2 =2.5. We demonstrate the potential of the long interrogation times available with this atom laser beam by measuring the trap frequency in a single measurement. The small beam width together with the long evolution and interrogation time makes this atom laser beam a promising tool for continuous interferometric measurements.},

	volume = {15},
	abstract = {It is shown that the transverse inhomogeneity of a strong   electromagnetic beam can exert a strong effect on the electrons and   atoms of a medium. Thus, if the frequency exceeds the natural frequency   of the electron oscillations (in a plasma or in atoms), then the   electrons or atoms will be forced out of the beam field. At   subresonance frequencies, the particles will be pulled in, the force   being especially large at resonance. It is noted that this effect can   create either a rarefaction or a compression in the beam and at the   focus of the radiation, maintain a pressure gradient near an opening   from an evacuated vessel to the atmosphere, and create a channel for   the passage of charged particles in the medium. It is shown that the   strong thermal ionizing and separating effects of the ray on the medium   can be used to set up waveguide propagation conditions and to eliminate   divergence of the beam (self-focusing). It is noted that hollow beams   can give rise to directional flow and ejection of the plasma along the   beam axis for plasma transport and creation of plasma current   conductors. The possibilities of accelerating and heating plasma   electrons by a modulated beam are indicated.},

	abstract = {Cold atom electron and ion sources produce electron bunches and ion beams by photoionization of laser-cooled atoms. They offer high coherence and the potential for high brightness, with applications including ultra-fast electron-diffractive imaging of dynamic processes at the nanoscale. The effective brightness of electron sources has been limited by nonlinear divergence caused by repulsive interactions between the electrons, known as the Coulomb explosion. It has been shown that electron bunches with ellipsoidal shape and uniform density distribution have linear internal Coulomb fields, such that the Coulomb explosion can be reversed using conventional optics. Our source can create bunches shaped in three dimensions and hence in principle achieve the transverse spatial coherence and brightness needed for picosecond-diffractive imaging with nanometer resolution. Here we present results showing how the shaping capability can be used to measure the spatial coherence properties of the cold electron source. We also investigate space-charge effects with ions and generate electron bunches with durations of a few hundred picoseconds. Future development of the cold atom electron and ion source will increase the bunch charge and charge density, demonstrate reversal of Coulomb explosion, and ultimately, ultra-fast coherent electron-diffractive imaging.},

Almost all components are standard vacuum parts. The heating elements and thermocouples are external to the vacuum, protecting them from the hostile hot alkali environment and allowing repair without breaking vacuum. The thermal source is followed by a Zeeman slower with a single-layer coil of variable winding pitch. The single-layer design is simple to construct and has low inductance which allows for rapid switching of the magnetic field. The coil pitch was determined by fitting the analytic form of the magnetic field for a variable winding pitch to the desired magnetic field profile required to slow atoms. The measured magnetic field for the constructed coil is in excellent agreement with the desired field. The source produces atoms at 35 m/s with a flux up to 2 x 10(10) cm(-2) s(-1) at 200 degrees C.},

While much has been achieved thanks to modern ultrafast laser technology, the ultimate coherent light source, the X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL), promises to deliver the highest X-ray photon flux in the shortest pulses at energies unreachable by conventional solid-state lasers. In parallel, other approaches that utilize electrons in table-top setups as a probe have been developed demonstrating the potential for a valid complement to X-ray based techniques. Here, we consider yet another possible avenue in which the technology of electron diffraction and imaging is pushed further; we estimate the interest and performances of a femtosecond high energy electron microscope and propose a hybrid experiment with relativistic electrons as a probe and fs X-ray pulses as a pump taking advantage of both technologies.},

Delay time ( t d ) measurements have shown that the experimental value of t d is almost three orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical value, calculated in a simple electrothermal model. This suggests that under non-equilibrium conditions (in high electric fields) electron correlation effects contribute to the development of the insulator to metal transition. The extra-carrier injection from Si into VO 2 was carried out in the structures Si-SiO 2 -VO 2 on p-type silicon with ρ = 0.1 Ω cm and a SiO 2 thickness 70 nm. It has been shown that the metal-insulator transition in VO 2 can be initiated by injection, i.e. by the increase of the electron density. The value of the critical density was found to be of the order of the electron density in VO 2 in the semiconducting phase, approximately 10 18 -10 19 cm -3 . This confirms that the metal-insulator transition in VO 2 is the purely electronic Mott-Hubbard transition.},

We demonstrate focusing of the ions to a spot size of 5.8±1.0 nm and a minimum two-sample deviation of the beam position of 1.5 nm in the focal plane. The deterministic source, even when used in combination with an imperfect detector, gives rise to a fivefold increase in the signal-to-noise ratio as compared with conventional Poissonian sources. Gating of the detector signal by the extraction event suppresses dark counts by 6 orders of magnitude. We implement a Bayes experimental design approach to microscopy in order to maximize the gain in spatial information. We demonstrate this method by determining the position of a 1 μm circular hole structure to a precision of 2.7 nm using only 579 probe particles.},

A semiclassical model allows us to analytically calculate the detuning-dependent refractive index of the system. The predicted Autler-Townes splitting and our experimental measurements are in excellent agreement. DCI provided a quantitative image of the distribution of the excited-state fraction, and compared with on-resonance absorption and blue cascade fluorescence techniques, was found to be experimentally simple and robust.},

A systematic investigation of all relevant frequency shifts and noise contributions yields a stability of 2.4×10-11τ-1/2, where τ is the integration time in seconds. Based on a set of technical improvements, the presented frequency standard is predicted to rival the stability of microwave fountain clocks in a potentially much more compact setup.},

Then by covering both slits with a layer of amorphous material and carrying out the experiment in a conventional transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy filter we can demonstrate that the diffraction pattern, taken by selecting the elastically scattered electrons, shows the presence of interference fringes, but with a bimodal envelope which can be accounted for by taking into account the non-constant thickness of the deposited layer. However, the intensity of the inelastically scattered electrons in the diffraction plane is very broad and at the limit of detectability. Therefore the experiment was repeated using an aluminum film and a microscope also equipped with a Schottky field emission gun. It was thus possible to observe also the image due to the inelastically scattered electron, which does not show interference phenomena both in the Fraunhofer or Fresnel regimes. If we assume that inelastic scattering through the thin layer covering the slits provides the dissipative process of interaction responsible for the localization mechanism, then these experiments can be considered a variant of the Feynman which-way thought experiment.

A number of different Mott polarimeter designs are described that illustrate the wide range of operating energies (10 eV–1 MeV) and geometries that can be used in such instruments. The calibration of Mott polarimeters is discussed together with the potential sources of systematic error that can arise and that can limit measurement accuracies.

	abstract = {External control of the conductivity of correlated oxides is one of the most promising schemes for realizing energy-efficient electronic devices. Vanadium dioxide (VO2), an archetypal correlated oxide compound, undergoes a temperature-driven metal–insulator transition near room temperature with a concomitant change in crystal symmetry. Here, we show that the metal–insulator transition temperature of thin VO2(001) films can be changed continuously from {\textasciitilde}285 to {\textasciitilde}345 K by varying the thickness of the RuO2 buffer layer (resulting in different epitaxial strains). Using strain-, polarization- and temperature-dependent X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in combination with X-ray diffraction and electronic transport measurements, we demonstrate that the transition temperature and the structural distortion across the transition depend on the orbital occupancy in the metallic state. Our findings open up the possibility of controlling the conductivity in atomically thin VO2 layers by manipulating the orbital occupancy by, for example, heterostructural engineering.

It is shown that all three methods are equivalent, in contrast with previously reported difficulties in obtaining consistency in the phase. Each method is illustrated by calculating the Rabi frequencies for each hyperfine transition in a n2S1/2-n'2q3/2 manifold. The importance of consistency in the ordering of the quantum numbers in matrix elements of operator components is discussed.},

The Shannon sampling, defined by the transform of the periodically repeated autocorrelation of the object, is related to Bragg scattering from an equivalent crystal, and shown to be consistent with the sampling of Young's fringes established by scattering from extreme points in the object.

Because of their short mean free path, electrons are particularly well suited for investigating surfaces and thin films, such as the challenging and important class of membrane proteins. To perform single-shot diffraction experiments on protein crystals, an ultracold electron source was proposed, based on near-threshold photoionization of laser-cooled atoms, which is capable of producing electron pulses of both high intensity and high coherence. Here we show that high coherence electron pulses can be produced by femtosecond photoionization, opening up a new regime of ultrafast structural dynamics experiments. The transverse coherence turns out to be much better than expected on the basis of the large bandwidth of the femtosecond ionization laser pulses. This surprising result can be explained by analysis of classical electron trajectories.},

In analogy to the Pound-Drever-Hall method, which uses a cavity as a memory of the laser phase, this method uses atomic coherence (dipole oscillations) as a phase memory of the transmitting laser field. A preliminary experiment using a distributed feedback laser diode and a rubidium vapor cell demonstrates a shot-noise-limited laser linewidth reduction (from 2 MHz to 20 kHz). This method would improve the performance of gas-cell-based optical atomic clocks and magnetometers and facilitate laser-cooling experiments using narrow transitions.},

	abstract = {The measurement of emittance in space-charge dominated, high brightness beam systems is investigated from conceptual, computational, and experimental viewpoints. As the self-field-induced collective motion in the low energy, high brightness beams emitted from photoinjector rf guns are more important in determining the macroscopic beam evolution than thermal spreads in transverse velocity; traditional methods for phase space diagnosis fail in these systems. We discuss the role of space charge forces in a traditional measurement of transverse emittance, the quadrupole scan. The mitigation of these effects by use of multislit- or pepper-pot-based techniques is explained. The results of a direct experimental comparison between quadrupole scanning and slit-based determination of the emittance of a 5 MeV high brightness electron beam are presented. These data are interpreted with the aid of both envelope and multiparticle simulation codes. It is shown that the ratio of the beam’s β function to its transverse plasma wavelength plays a central role in the quadrupole scan results. Methods of determining the presence of systematic errors in quadrupole scan data are discussed.},

	abstract = {How to make vanadium dioxide metallic
At about 70°C, the material vanadium dioxide (VO2) switches from being a semiconductor to a metal. The switch happens so fast that it may be useful in electronic devices, but it is not clear whether the switch is primarily caused by enhanced interactions between electrons or by a change in the crystal structure. Morrison et al. shone laser light on a sample of VO2, initially in a semiconducting state. They used electron diffraction to monitor the changes in the material's crystal structure and simultaneously measured its optical properties to monitor the electronic state. For certain laser powers, VO2 switched to a long-lived metallic state even though it preserved its initial crystal structure.
Science, this issue p. 445
The complex interplay among several active degrees of freedom (charge, lattice, orbital, and spin) is thought to determine the electronic properties of many oxides. We report on combined ultrafast electron diffraction and infrared transmissivity experiments in which we directly monitored and separated the lattice and charge density reorganizations that are associated with the optically induced semiconductor-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2). By photoexciting the monoclinic semiconducting phase, we were able to induce a transition to a metastable state that retained the periodic lattice distortion characteristic of the semiconductor but also acquired metal-like mid-infrared optical properties. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast electron diffraction is capable of following details of both lattice and electronic structural dynamics on the ultrafast time scale.
Simultaneous measurements of structural and optical properties are used to study optically excited vanadium dioxide.

This technique combines the efficient capture of atoms from a MOT into a magnetic trap with the rapid evaporation of optical dipole traps; the approach is insensitive to the peak quadrupole gradient and the precise trapping beam waist.

This is true whether neutrons, electrons or X-rays are used as the illumination. For neutrons, the cross-section for nuclear capture and the associated energy deposition and radiation damage could be reduced by using samples that are fully deuterated and 15N-labelled and by using fast neutrons, but single molecule biological microscopy is still not feasible. For naturally occurring biological material, electrons at present provide the most information for a given amount of radiation damage. Using phase contrast electron microscopy on biological molecules and macromolecular assemblies of approximately 10(5) molecular weight and above, there is in theory enough information present in the image to allow determination of the position and orientation of individual particles: the application of averaging methods can then be used to provide an atomic resolution structure. The images of approximately 10,000 particles are required. Below 10(5) molecular weight, some kind of crystal or other geometrically ordered aggregate is necessary to provide a sufficiently high combined molecular weight to allow for the alignment. In practice, the present quality of the best images still falls short of that attainable in theory and this means that a greater number of particles must be averaged and that the molecular weight limitation is somewhat larger than the predicted limit. For X-rays, the amount of damage per useful elastic scattering event is several hundred times greater than for electrons at all wavelengths and energies and therefore the requirements on specimen size and number of particles are correspondingly larger. Because of the lack of sufficiently bright neutron sources in the foreseeable future, electron microscopy in practice provides the greatest potential for immediate progress.},

We load a single beam dipole trap directly from a magneto-optic trap (MOT). After evaporation in the single beam, a second crossed beam is used for compression. The intensity in both beams is then reduced for evaporation to BEC. We obtain a BEC with \$3.5x10{\textasciicircum}4\$ atoms after 3 s of total evaporation time. We also give a detailed account of the thermal distribution in cross beam traps. This account highlights the possible difficulties in using shorter wavelength lasers to condense all optically.},

They have the potential to replace photographic film in nearly all transmission electron microscopy (TEM) applications. They also make high-quality TEM images available in a computer within seconds of recording, and this is creating new opportunities for on-line image processing and automated TEM. We describe the principles underlying the construction and operation of SSC cameras, illustrate them with the particular case of Gatan SSCs, and document the versatility of the camera with several examples. We then describe an SSC-based TEM autotuning procedure which automatically analyzes diffractograms of captured images, and aligns (to the coma-free axis), stigmates, and focuses a high-resolution electron microscope faster and with better precision than even the most skilled human operators.},

Cooling rates of up to ≈300 μK/s are observed without significant atom loss. The final temperature achieved was (a somewhat disappointing) 17 μK. Experimental studies and theoretical analysis of this cooling process were carried out, which explain that the temperature limit is due to an equilibrium between the small fraction of total thermal energy that is removed per Sisyphus cycle and the multiple photon recoils that are required to complete each cycle. Light-induced collisional loss made it difficult to operate under conditions where a larger fraction of the energy would be removed. A method for storing atoms in an optical trap with only a single confined spin state is also demonstrated.},

This elegant technique, whereby atoms, molecules, and even microscopic beads of glass, can be trapped in small regions of free space by beams of light and subsequently moved at will using other beams, has revolutionized many areas of physics. In particular, it provides a useful research tool for the study of individual atoms, for investigating the details of chemical reactions, and even for the study of atomic motion in the quantum domain.This text begins with a review of the relevant aspects of quantum mechanics; it then turns to the electromagnetic interactions involved in slowing and trapping atoms, in both magnetic and optical traps. The concluding chapters discuss a broad range of applications, including atomic clocks, studies of ultra-cold collision processes, diffraction and interference of atomic beams, optical lattices, and Bose-Einstein condensation. The book is intended for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students who have some basic knowledge of optics and quantum mechanics.

Both planar and sandwich thin-film MOM devices based on VO2 exhibit electrical switching with an S-shaped I-V characteristic, and this switching effect is associated with the metal-insulator transition (MIT). In an electrical circuit containing such a switching device, relaxation oscillations are observed if the load line intersects the I-V curve at a unique point in NDR region. All these effects are potentially prospective for designing various devices of oxide electronics, particularly, elements of dynamical neural networks based on coupled oscillators.},

Nonetheless, they are known to exhibit discrete energy levels due to quantum confinement effects. We show that, like single-atom or single-molecule two- and three-level quantum systems, single semiconductor quantum dots can also exhibit interference phenomena when driven simultaneously by two optical fields. Probe absorption spectra are obtained that exhibit Autler-Townes splitting when the optical fields drive coupled transitions and complex Mollow-related structure, including gain without population inversion, when they drive the same transition. Our results open the way for the demonstration of numerous quantum level–based applications, such as quantum dot lasers, optical modulators, and quantum logic devices.},

	abstract = {Protein characterization plays a role in two key aspects of structural proteomics. The first is the quality assessment of the produced protein preparations. Obtaining well diffracting crystals is one of the major bottlenecks in the structure-determination pipeline. Often, this is caused by the poor quality of the protein preparation used for crystallization trials. Hence, it is essential to perform an extensive quality assessment of the protein preparations prior to crystallization and to use the results in the evaluation of the process. Here, a protein-production and crystallization strategy is proposed with threshold values for protein purity (95\%) and monodispersity (85\%) below which a further optimization of the protein-production process is strongly recommended. The second aspect is the determination of protein characteristics such as domains, oligomeric state, post-translational modifications and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. In this paper, applications and new developments of protein-characterization methods using MS, fluorescence spectroscopy, static light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering within the EC Structural Proteomics in Europe contract are described.

We use an approach of the Weisskopf-Wigner type to investigate the interaction of the dressed states of the atom-driving field system to the surrouding environment, and calculate the linewidth of the resonance fluorescence spectrum in terms of the decay rate of the dressed coherences. Unlike the conventional theory, we deal first with the exact interaction of the atom with the driving laser field, and then consider the coupling of this combined system to the modes of the environment within the Weisskopf-Wigner approximation. This modification of the traditional sequence in which the interactions are handled leads to a sensitive dependence of the fluorescence spectrum on the density of modes and suggests that a driven atom placed in a suitable environment, such as for example a high-Q resonator, even if Markovian, might behave quite differently from an identical system in free space. The significance of this effect is shown explicitly for the case of a strongly driven two level atom in an environment with a modal density which is substantially frequency dependent on the scale of the Rabi frequency of the driving laser field.},

Moreover, multiple physical phases or domains with dimensions of nanometres to micrometres can coexist in these materials at temperatures where a pure phase is expected. Making use of the properties of correlated electron materials in device applications will require the ability to control domain structures and phase transitions in these materials. Lattice strain has been shown to cause the coexistence of metallic and insulating phases in the Mott insulator VO2. Here, we show that we can nucleate and manipulate ordered arrays of metallic and insulating domains along single-crystal beams of VO2 by continuously tuning the strain over a wide range of values. The Mott transition between a low-temperature insulating phase and a high-temperature metallic phase usually occurs at 341 K in VO2, but the active control of strain allows us to reduce this transition temperature to room temperature. In addition to device applications, the ability to control the phase structure of VO2 with strain could lead to a deeper understanding of the correlated electron materials in general.},

	abstract = {Electron diffraction from metalcoated freestanding nanofabricated gratings is presented, with a quantitative path integral analysis of the electron-grating interactions. Electron diffraction out to the 20th order was observed indicating the high quality of our nanofabricated gratings. The electron beam is collimated to its diffraction limit with ion-milled material slits. Our path integral analysis is first tested against single slit electron diffraction, and then further expanded with the same theoretical approach to describe gratingdiffraction. Rotation of the grating with respect to the incident electron beam varies the effective distance between the electron and grating bars. This allows the measurement of the image charge potential between the electron and the grating bars. Image charge potentials that were about 15\% of the value for that of a pure electron-metal wall interaction were found. We varied the electron energy from 50 to 900 eV . The interaction time is of the order of typical metal image charge response times and in principle allows the investigation of image charge formation. In addition to the image charge interaction there is a dephasing process reducing the transverse coherence length of the electron wave. The dephasing process causes broadening of the diffraction peaks and is consistent with a model that ascribes the dephasing process to microscopic contact potentials. Surface structures with length scales of about 200 nm observed with a scanning tunneling microscope, and dephasing interaction strength typical of contact potentials of 0.35 eV support this claim. Such a dephasing model motivated the investigation of different metallic coatings, in particular Ni, Ti, Al, and different thickness Au–Pd coatings. Improved quality of diffraction patterns was found for Ni. This coating made electron diffraction possible at energies as low as 50 eV . This energy was limited by our electron gun design. These results are particularly relevant for the use of these gratings as coherent beam splitters in low energy electron interferometry.},

The loading is a dynamical process determined by a loading rate and a density dependent loss rate. The loading rate depends on cooling and the flux of atoms into the trapping volume, and the loss rate is due to excited state collisions induced by the MOT light fields. From this study we found ways to optimize the loading of the optical dipole trap. Key ingredients for maximum loading are found to be a reduction of the hyperfine repump intensity, increased detuning of the MOT light, and a displacement of the optical dipole trap center with respect to the MOT. A factor of 2 increase in the number of loaded atoms is demonstrated by using a hyperfine repump beam with a shadow in it. In this way we load 8×10685Rb atoms into a 1 mK deep optical dipole trap with a waist of 58 {\textbackslash}mu m, which is 40\% of the atoms initially trapped in the MOT.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast electron diffraction enables the study of molecular structural dynamics with atomic resolution at subpicosecond timescales, with applications in solid-state physics and rational drug design. Progress with ultrafast electron diffraction has been constrained by the limited transverse coherence of high-current electron sources. Photoionization of laser-cooled atoms can produce electrons of intrinsically high coherence, but has been too slow for ultrafast electron diffraction. Ionization with femtosecond lasers should in principle reduce the electron pulse duration, but the high bandwidth inherent to short laser pulses is expected to destroy the transverse coherence. Here we demonstrate that a two-colour process with femtosecond excitation followed by nanosecond photoionization can produce picosecond electron bunches with high transverse coherence. Ultimately, the unique combination of ultrafast ionization, high coherence and three-dimensional bunch shaping capabilities of cold atom electron sources have the potential for realising the brightness and coherence requirements for single-shot electron diffraction from crystalline biological samples.

At present, significant disagreement exists regarding features of the disordered Bose–Hubbard model, which is used to study disorder in strongly correlated bosonic systems. Here, by measuring transport in a disordered optical lattice, we discover a disorder-induced superfluid-to-insulator transition in this system, in quantitative agreement with a predicted superfluid–Bose-glass transition from recent numerical simulations. Both the superfluid-to-insulator transition and correlated changes in the atomic quasimomentum distribution—which verify a simple model for the interplay of disorder and interactions in this system—are phenomena new to the unit-filling regime explored in this work. We find that increasing disorder strength generically leads to greater dissipation, excluding predictions of a disorder-induced or ‘re-entrant’ superfluid. Whereas the absence of a re-entrant superfluid may be explained by finite temperature, the measured bounds on entropy strongly constrain theory.},

Protocols for sample preparation, data collection, and analysis are given.A recent development is the fluorescence-based thermal shift (ThermoFluor) assay. It uses an environmentally sensitive dye, Sypro Orange, to monitor the thermal stability of a protein and investigate factors (e.g., buffers, additives, and ligands) affecting this stability. This chapter describes the application of this method using a 96-condition in-house screen. The measurements are performed on a commercially available real-time PCR machine. Multiangle or static light scattering (SLS) is a very powerful technique to determine the conformational state of proteins in solution, especially when used in combination with size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In the authors' experimental set-up the SLS detector is connected in-line to a standard protein purification machine (e.g., the Akta Purifier) equipped with an analytical SEC column.

	abstract = {Imaging a single protein has been a long-standing dream for advancing structural biology and with this various fields in natural science. In particular, revealing the distinct conformations of an individual protein is of outermost importance. To do so, one needs to master and combine three requirements. At first, a method for isolating individual proteins for further inspection has to be at hand; quite the opposite to the current challenge of assembling proteins into a crystal for X-ray analysis. Furthermore, technologies are required for keeping a single protein fixed in space long enough to accumulate sufficient structural information from a scattering experiment. Last but not least, gentle radiation with a wavelength small enough to uncover structural details while ensuring that radiation damage does not decompose the protein during observation as it is available by low-energy electron holography is vital for imaging. Here we show that soft-landing electrospray beam deposition allows for specific selection and sound deposition of individual proteins and protein complexes onto ultraclean freestanding graphene in an ultra-high vacuum environment. Due to the fact that graphene is transparent for low-energy electrons and since the latter do not damage biological molecules, we were able to acquire high signal-to-noise ratio electron holograms of individual proteins (Cytochrome C and BSA) as well as of protein complexes (haemoglobin). The numerical hologram reconstructions reveal the overall shape of single proteins. With this, images of individual folded proteins and protein complexes, not being the result of an averaging process, have been obtained for the first time.},

Localized excitations were induced by suddenly modifying the trapping potential using the optical dipole force of a focused laser beam. The resulting propagation of sound was observed using a novel technique, rapid sequencing of nondestructive phase-contrast images. The speed of sound was determined as a function of density and found to be consistent with Bogoliubov theory. This method may generally be used to observe high-lying modes and perhaps second sound.},

Due to light-induced two-body collisions during the loading stage of the trap the maximum number of captured atoms is locked to one. This collisional blockade effect is confirmed by the observation of photon antibunching in the detected fluorescence light. The spectral properties of single photons emitted by the atom were studied with a narrow-band scanning cavity. We find that the atomic fluorescence spectrum is dominated by the spectral width of the exciting laser light field. In addition we observe a spectral broadening of the atomic fluorescence light due to the Doppler effect. This allows us to determine the mean kinetic energy of the trapped atom corresponding to a temperature of 105 μK. This simple single-atom trap is the key element for the generation of atom-photon entanglement required for future applications in quantum communication and a first loophole-free test of Bell’s inequality.},

	abstract = {Rotary voice-coil motors from computer hard disk drives make excellent mechanical shutters for light beams. However, the complexity of the necessary electronic driving circuit can hinder their application. A new design is presented here, using a single integrated circuit originally intended for controlling dc motors. A digital input signal switches a unipolar power supply bidirectionally through the voice coil. Short high-current pulses are generated on the transitions to ensure rapid shutter action, while a low holding current reduces the power requirement and heating of the actuator. The circuit can reverse the current to brake the shutter and reduce the impact at the end of its travel. With a focused laser beam, the shutter achieves rise times below 500 ns. A method for producing variable length pulses is also described, demonstrating durations as short as 700 ns.},

	abstract = {Continuous wave extended cavity diode lasers are used to measure the absorptive and dispersive properties of the 5 2S1/2 → 5 2P3/2 resonance, at 780 nm, in Rubidium (Rb) vapour. The Doppler-broadened hyperfine transitions are studied both with and without a pump beam. The investigation concentrates on three-level Λ-systems, realized in the presence of a pump beam, exhibiting Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT). Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) is also seen. The EIT and EIA resonances can be several orders of magnitude narrower than the natural line width of the atomic transitions in the absence of the pump beam. Further, the EIT resonances are sensitive to applied magnetic fields.
The narrowest resonances measured in this work have a full-width at halfmaximum of ∼ 80 kHz. This is limited by the transit time of the atoms through
the probe and pump beams.
Predictions of theoretical calculations and models are compared to experimental
results. The theory of beam splitters and interferometers is developed to enable
the implementation of a Sagnac interferometer in a novel “biased” alignment.
This allows the dispersion of atomic resonances to be measured directly.
The direct measurement of the dispersion of the narrow EIT features in a “biased”
Sagnac interferometer is presented. Such a signal is ideally suited to
precision measurement applications such as inertial sensing and magnetometry},

Cooling can slow sample deterioration, but cannot eliminate damage-induced sample movement during the time needed for conventional measurements1, 2. Analyses of the dynamics of damage formation3, 4, 5 suggest that the conventional damage barrier (about 200 X-ray photons per Å2 with X-rays of 12 keV energy or 1 Å wavelength2) may be extended at very high dose rates and very short exposure times. Here we have used computer simulations to investigate the structural information that can be recovered from the scattering of intense femtosecond X-ray pulses by single protein molecules and small assemblies. Estimations of radiation damage as a function of photon energy, pulse length, integrated pulse intensity and sample size show that experiments using very high X-ray dose rates and ultrashort exposures may provide useful structural information before radiation damage destroys the sample. We predict that such ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray pulses from free-electron lasers6, 7 that are currently under development, in combination with container-free sample handling methods based on spraying techniques, will provide a new approach to structural determinations with X-rays.},

The atoms at the far detuning of the Raman coupling are loaded adiabatically into the dressed states by ramping the homogeneous bias magnetic field with different paths and the dressed states with different energies are studied experimentally. The experimental scheme can be easily extended to produce the synthetic magnetic or electric field by means of a spatial or time dependence of the effective vector potential.},

	abstract = {Femtosecond electron diffraction (FED) has the potential to directly observe transition state processes. The relevant motions for this barrier-crossing event occur on the hundred femtosecond time-scale. Recent advances in the development of high-flux electron pulse sources with the required time resolution and sensitivity to capture barrier-crossing processes are described in the context of attaining atomic level details of such structural dynamics-seeing chemical events as they occur. Initial work focused on the ordered-to-disordered phase transition of Al under strong driving conditions for which melting takes on nm or molecular scale dimensions. This work has been extended to Au, which clearly shows a separation in time-scales for lattice heating and melting. It also demonstrates that superheated face-centred cubic (FCC) metals melt through thermal mechanisms involving homogeneous nucleation to propagate the disordering process. A new concept exploiting electron-electron correlation is introduced for pulse characterization and determination of t=0 to within 100 fs as well as for spatial manipulation of the electron beam. Laser-based methods are shown to provide further improvements in time resolution with respect to pulse characterization, absolute t=0 determination, and the potential for electron acceleration to energies optimal for time-resolved diffraction.},

In particular, the high degree of control of experimental parameters has allowed the study of many interesting phenomena, such as quantum phase transitions and quantum spin dynamics. Here we demonstrate how such control can be implemented at the most fundamental level of a single spin at a specific site of an optical lattice. Using a tightly focused laser beam together with a microwave field, we were able to flip the spin of individual atoms in a Mott insulator with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, well below the lattice spacing. The Mott insulator provided us with a large two-dimensional array of perfectly arranged atoms, in which we created arbitrary spin patterns by sequentially addressing selected lattice sites after freezing out the atom distribution. We directly monitored the tunnelling quantum dynamics of single atoms in the lattice prepared along a single line, and observed that our addressing scheme leaves the atoms in the motional ground state. The results should enable studies of entropy transport and the quantum dynamics of spin impurities, the implementation of novel cooling schemes, and the engineering of quantum many-body phases and various quantum information processing applications.},

	title = {Use of an {Optical} dipole {Trap} in a {Cold}-atom {Electron} {Source}},
	abstract = {The University of Melbourne’s cold-atom electron source (CAES) project aims to
create short, high-brightness, high-coherence electron bunches for use in ultra-fast,
single-shot coherent diffractive imaging (CDI). The imaging of nanoscale objects such as
biological molecules and defects in solid-state devices by ultrafast, single-shot electron
diffractive imaging would provide important information about structure and dynamic
processes. If the CAES is successful then it will be able to determine the structure
of essential molecules, such as membrane proteins, and create ‘molecular movies’ of
chemical reactions.
The CAES operates by ionising rubidium-85 atoms that have been cooled and
trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). This ionisation is a two-stage process that
produces extremely cold electron bunches (T = 10 K) which are accelerated towards
the sample under investigation. During ionisation the trapping must be turned off.
This causes the atom cloud to expand and residual magnetic fields interfere with the
trajectories of the electron bunches.
An optical dipole trap (ODT) has been designed, constructed and integrated with
the CAES during the course of this project. The ODT stabilises the trajectories of
the electron bunches which is essential for imaging. The ODT consists of two 700 mW
Gaussian laser beams whose foci overlap with each other and the MOT atom cloud.
Atoms feel a force towards the high intensity regions of the ODT beams, such as the
foci. This serves to trap the atoms and is used to hold the atoms in place while the
residual magnetic fields from the MOT dissipate and thus produce electron bunches
free from magnetic disturbance.},

	abstract = {Since the first observation of electron diffraction in 1927, electrons have been used to probe the structure of matter. High-brightness sources of thermal electrons have recently emerged that are capable of simultaneously providing high spatial resolving power along with ultrafast temporal resolution, however they are yet to demonstrate the holy grail of single-shot diffraction of non-crystalline objects. The development of the cold atom electron source, based around the ionisation of laser cooled atoms, has the potential to contribute to this goal. Electron generation from laser cooled atoms is in its infancy, but in just ten years has moved from a proposal to a source capable of performing single-shot diffraction imaging of crystalline structures. The high brightness, high transverse coherence length, and small energy spread of cold electron sources are also potentially advantageous for applications ranging from seeding of x-ray free-electron lasers and synchrotrons to coherent diffractive imaging and microscopy. In this review we discuss the context which motivates the development of these sources, the operating principles of the source, and recent experimental results. The achievements demonstrated thus far combined with theoretical proposals to alleviate current bottlenecks in development promise a bright future for these sources.},

By selecting a two-color multiphoton excitation process, bunches with durations as low as the measurement resolution limit of 130ps are measured using a streak technique. Verification that ultrafast cold-electron bunches can be generated by photoionization of cold atoms is an important step towards their application in high-brightness ultrafast electron diffraction and injectors for particle accelerators.},

We demonstrate how low energy can be advantageous in ion microscopy when detecting backscattered ions, due to a decreased interaction volume and the potential for surface sensitive composition analysis.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a three-dimensional quasistatic model for high brightness beam dynamics simulation in rf/dc photoinjectors, rf linacs, and similar devices on parallel computers. In this model, electrostatic space-charge forces within a charged particle beam are calculated self-consistently at each time step by solving the three-dimensional Poisson equation in the beam frame and then transforming back to the laboratory frame. When the beam has a large energy spread, it is divided into a number of energy bins or slices so that the space-charge forces are calculated from the contribution of each bin and summed together. Image-charge effects from conducting photocathode are also included efficiently using a shifted-Green function method. For a beam with large aspect ratio, e.g., during emission, an integrated Green function method is used to solve the three-dimensional Poisson equation. Using this model, we studied beam transport in one Linac Coherent Light Sources photoinjector design through the first traveling wave linac with initial misalignment with respect to the accelerating axis.},

The pulse length has been measured using a resonant 3 GHz deflecting cavity in TM110 mode. We have measured the pulse length in three ionization regimes. The first is direct two-photon photoionization using only a 480 nm femtosecond laser pulse, which results in short (∼15 ps) but hot (∼104 K) electron bunches. The second regime is just-above-threshold femtosecond photoionization employing the combination of a continuous-wave 780 nm excitation laser and a tunable 480 nm femtosecond ionization laser which results in both ultracold (∼10 K) and ultrafast (∼25 ps) electron bunches. These pulses typically contain ∼103 electrons and have a root-mean-square normalized transverse beam emittance of 1.5 ± 0.1 nm rad. The measured pulse lengths are limited by the energy spread associated with the longitudinal size of the ionization volume, as expected. The third regime is just-below-threshold ionization which produces Rydberg states which slowly ionize on microsecond time scales.},

	abstract = {The three-dimensional structures of macromolecules and their complexes are mainly elucidated by X-ray protein crystallography. A major limitation of this method is access to high-quality crystals, which is necessary to ensure X-ray diffraction extends to sufficiently large scattering angles and hence yields information of sufficiently high resolution with which to solve the crystal structure. The observation that crystals with reduced unit-cell volumes and tighter macromolecular packing often produce higher-resolution Bragg peaks suggests that crystallographic resolution for some macromolecules may be limited not by their heterogeneity, but by a deviation of strict positional ordering of the crystalline lattice. Such displacements of molecules from the ideal lattice give rise to a continuous diffraction pattern that is equal to the incoherent sum of diffraction from rigid individual molecular complexes aligned along several discrete crystallographic orientations and that, consequently, contains more information than Bragg peaks alone. Although such continuous diffraction patterns have long been observed—and are of interest as a source of information about the dynamics of proteins—they have not been used for structure determination. Here we show for crystals of the integral membrane protein complex photosystem II that lattice disorder increases the information content and the resolution of the diffraction pattern well beyond the 4.5-ångström limit of measurable Bragg peaks, which allows us to phase the pattern directly. Using the molecular envelope conventionally determined at 4.5 ångströms as a constraint, we obtain a static image of the photosystem II dimer at a resolution of 3.5 ångströms. This result shows that continuous diffraction can be used to overcome what have long been supposed to be the resolution limits of macromolecular crystallography, using a method that exploits commonly encountered imperfect crystals and enables model-free phasing.},

For beam focusing of the IH-DTL, the method of Alternating-Phase-Focusing (APF) was employed. The compact injector can accelerate heavy ions having a charge-to-mass ratio of qm=13 up to 4.0MeV/u. Use of the APF IH-DTL and operating frequency of 200MHz allowed us to design compact linacs; the total length of the two linacs is less than 6m. Beam-acceleration tests of the compact injector system were performed. The measured intensity of accelerated C4+12 beams with the compact injector was 380eμA. Beam transmission of the APF IH-DTL was estimated to be as high as 96\%, which is comparable to the value calculated by a simulation code. Transverse phase-space and energy distributions of accelerated beams were measured and compared with those calculated by the simulation code, and we found that they were agreed well with each other.},

We derive closed, analytic expressions for the increase in transverse emittance and energy spread of the electron distribution. We demonstrate that for the special case of a beam focused in the center of the cavity, the low emittance and low energy spread of a high quality beam can be maintained, which allows high-repetition rate, ultrafast electron microscopy with 100 fs temporal resolution combined with the atomic resolution of a high-end TEM. This is confirmed by charged particle tracking simulations using a realistic cavity geometry, including fringe fields at the cavity entrance and exit apertures.},

	abstract = {Observing matter on atomic length and time scales simultaneously is now routinely achieved in ultrafast electron and X-ray imaging techniques, but continued advances in both approaches promise to deliver huge leaps in our understanding of all kinds of atomic structures and processes. Both technologies rely on the generation of ultrabright, ultrashort duration electron bunches, with these bunches being used directly to probe the sample in electron diffraction, or to generate ultrabright X-ray pulses in X-ray free electron lasers. 
 
The Cold Atom Electron and Ion Source (CAEIS) was conceived as a possible way to generate ultrafast electron bunches that are brighter than can currently be produced, with the aim of enabling next-generation structural determination techniques, particularly those based on electron diffraction. The CAEIS generates electrons by near-threshold photoionisation of an atomic gas, which has been shown to produce electron bunches with temperature as low as 10K. Such cold electron bunches have the potential to be much brighter than those generated from solid photocathode sources, which typically have temperatures in the thousands of Kelvin range. Extremely cold ions are also generated in the CAEIS, which show great potential for use in ion microscopy and milling.  
 
This thesis presents work on a number of different aspects of the continued development of the cold atom electron and ion source, with a particular emphasis on progress towards ultrafast single-shot electron diffraction based experiments. 
 
The brightness degrading effects of space-charge repulsion are investigated using nanosecond duration ion bunches as analogues of ultrafast, picosecond duration electron bunches. Ion bunch shaping was achieved through tailoring of the spatial profile of lasers used in ionisation of the atomic gas. It was found that atomic fluorescence could substantially reduce the fidelity with which the ion bunch profile could be controlled, but methods were developed to circumvent the fluorescence problem.  
 
The improved shaping procedures allowed generation of uniformly filled ellipsoidal bunches, which theoretically will not suffer emittance degradation under space-charge expansion. Emittance measurements following space-charge driven expansion showed that these uniformly filled ellipsoids did indeed have reduced emittance growth compared to other profiles. 
 
Photoexcitation and field-ionisation processes involved in generation of cold electrons on ultrafast timescales were investigated, with the aim of determining the mechanisms that affect the ultimate electron bunch duration. Bunch duration was measured for a range of excitation conditions, with the finding that previously assumed ultrafast excitation pathways in fact generated fairly slow nanosecond long bunches. Ionisation time could also be a million times slower than assumed if atoms were excited below the classical ionisation threshold. Identification of the conditions required for ultrafast excitation and ionisation ultimately allowed generation of ultrafast cold electron bunches with duration of tens of picoseconds.  
 
Electron diffraction using nanosecond long electron bunches was achieved in both transmission and reflection modes for a variety of large samples of inorganic crystals. Bunches were of sufficiently high charge to allow identification of features of a crystal structure using only a single shot. Bragg peaks could also be identified by averaging together many images formed using ultrafast, but low-charge bunches.  
 
Simulations were performed to determine the feasibility of using electrons generated in the CAEIS for electron coherent diffractive imaging of nanoscale apertures. It was found that it should be possible to successfully reconstruct the object plane wavefield, even taking into account realistic experimental parameters for partial coherence and noise.},

	abstract = {The very bright electron beam required for an x-ray free-electron laser (FEL), such as the linac coherent light source (LCLS), is susceptible to a microbunching instability in the magnetic bunch compressors, prior to the FEL undulator. The uncorrelated electron energy spread in the LCLS can be increased by an order of magnitude to provide strong Landau damping against the instability without degrading the FEL performance. To this end, a “laser-heater” system has been installed in the LCLS injector, which modulates the energy of a 135-MeV electron bunch with an IR-laser beam in a short undulator, enclosed within a four-dipole chicane. In this paper, we report detailed measurements of laser-heater-induced energy spread, including the unexpected self-heating phenomenon when the laser energy is very low. We discuss the suppression of the microbunching instability with the laser heater and its impact on the x-ray FEL performance. We also present the analysis of these experimental results and develop a three-dimensional longitudinal space charge model to explain the self-heating effect.},

	abstract = {A collimator located in a magnetic bunch compressor of a linear accelerator driven x-ray free electron laser has many potential applications, such as the removal of horns in the current distribution, the generation of ultrashort beams, and as a diagnostic of the beam slice emittance. Collective effects, however, are a major concern in applying the technique. Systematic measurements of emittance and analysis were performed using a collimator in the first bunch compressor of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). In the nominal, undercompressed configuration using the collimator we find that the y emittance (nonbending plane) is not increased, and the x emittance (in the bending plane) is increased by about 25\%, in comparison to the injector emittance. From the analysis we conclude that the parasitic effects associated with this method are dominated by coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR), which causes a “systematic error” for measuring slice emittance at the bending plane using the collimation method. In general, we find good agreement between the measurements and simulations including CSR. However, for overcompressed beams at smaller collimator gaps, an extra emittance increase is found that does not agree with 1D simulations and is not understood.},

The model considers the classical dynamics of the electron just after the photon absorption, i.e. its motion in the potential of a singly charged ion and a uniform electric field used for acceleration. From closed expressions for the asymptotic transverse electron velocities and trajectories, the effective source temperature and the virtual source size can be calculated. The influence of the acceleration field strength and the ionization laser energy on these properties has been studied. With this model, a single-atom electron source with the optimum electron beam properties can be designed. Furthermore, we show that the model is also applicable to ionization of rubidium atoms, and thus also describes the ultracold electron source, which is based on photoionization of laser-cooled alkali atoms.},

	abstract = {Probing interfaces with electrons
When molecules move on surfaces, they behave differently from when inside a solid. But surface layers give off limited signals, so to probe these systems, scientists need to act fast. Gulde et al. developed an ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction technique and used it to study how a polymer moved and melted on a graphene substrate (see the Perspective by Nibbering). After hitting the sample with a laser pulse, energy transferred across the graphene-polymer interface, the polymer film became less orderly, and an amorphous phase appeared.
Science, this issue p. 200; see also p. 137
Two-dimensional systems such as surfaces and molecular monolayers exhibit a multitude of intriguing phases and complex transitions. Ultrafast structural probing of such systems offers direct time-domain information on internal interactions and couplings to a substrate or bulk support. We have developed ultrafast low-energy electron diffraction and investigate in transmission the structural relaxation in a polymer/graphene bilayer system excited out of equilibrium. The laser-pump/electron-probe scheme resolves the ultrafast melting of a polymer superstructure consisting of folded-chain crystals registered to a free-standing graphene substrate. We extract the time scales of energy transfer across the bilayer interface, the loss of superstructure order, and the appearance of an amorphous phase with short-range correlations. The high surface sensitivity makes this experimental approach suitable for numerous problems in ultrafast surface science.

	abstract = {How to make vanadium dioxide metallic
At about 70°C, the material vanadium dioxide (VO2) switches from being a semiconductor to a metal. The switch happens so fast that it may be useful in electronic devices, but it is not clear whether the switch is primarily caused by enhanced interactions between electrons or by a change in the crystal structure. Morrison et al. shone laser light on a sample of VO2, initially in a semiconducting state. They used electron diffraction to monitor the changes in the material's crystal structure and simultaneously measured its optical properties to monitor the electronic state. For certain laser powers, VO2 switched to a long-lived metallic state even though it preserved its initial crystal structure.
Science, this issue p. 445
The complex interplay among several active degrees of freedom (charge, lattice, orbital, and spin) is thought to determine the electronic properties of many oxides. We report on combined ultrafast electron diffraction and infrared transmissivity experiments in which we directly monitored and separated the lattice and charge density reorganizations that are associated with the optically induced semiconductor-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2). By photoexciting the monoclinic semiconducting phase, we were able to induce a transition to a metastable state that retained the periodic lattice distortion characteristic of the semiconductor but also acquired metal-like mid-infrared optical properties. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast electron diffraction is capable of following details of both lattice and electronic structural dynamics on the ultrafast time scale.
Simultaneous measurements of structural and optical properties are used to study optically excited vanadium dioxide.

The text evaluates the limitations and benefits of using the different types of radiation sources, whether these are X-rays, neutrons, or electrons. Part II is a collection of reprints discussing the development of techniques that includes a modification of the Bragg method, which is a method of X-ray crystal analysis. One paper presents an improved numerical method of two-dimensional Fourier synthesis for crystals. This method uses a greatly reduced process of arrangement of sets of figures found in the two-dimensional Fourier series. The book also notes the theoretical considerations and the practical details, and then addresses precautions against possible inclusions of errors in this method. The text deals as well with the magnetic scattering of neutrons, and one paper presents a simple method of gathering information about the magnetic moment of the neutron besides the traditional Stern-Gerlach method.

Artificial structures imprinted on a Si3N4 window are excited with an optical laser and undergo laser ablation, which is imaged with a spatial resolution of 50 nm and a temporal resolution of 10 ps. By using the shortest available free-electron-laser wavelengths1 and proven synchronization methods2 this technique could be extended to spatial resolutions of a few nanometres and temporal resolutions of a few tens of femtoseconds.

We quantify the degradation of the diffraction pattern from ultrafast electronic damage by performing simulations on a biological sample exposed to x-ray pulses with different parameters. We find that the contrast is substantially reduced and the background is considerably strong only if almost all electrons are removed from their parent atoms.

The rapid progress and maturation of this field in recent years have to a large extent been made possible by the inspiration and generous support of several active structural genomics initiatives. Two tendencies can be currently observed: one which treats protein crystallography as a highly automatic tool for investigating various biological problems without the need to engage in the intricacies of the technique and a second approach where this method is applied to crystals of difficult, large and complex biological systems, requiring a deeper knowledge of various aspects of crystallography. In the near future it is expected that these two trends will coexist, developing in a parallel fashion.},

	abstract = {The light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin occurs naturally as two-dimensional crystals. A three-dimensional density map of the structure, at near-atomic resolution, has been obtained by studying the crystals using electron cryo-microscopy to obtain electron diffraction patterns and high-resolution micrographs. New methods were developed for analysing micrographs from tilted specimens, incorporating methods previously developed for untilted specimens that enable large areas to be analysed and corrected for distortions. Data from 72 images, from both tilted and untilted specimens, were analysed to produce the phases of 2700 independent Fourier components of the structure. The amplitudes of these components were accurately measured from 150 diffraction patterns. Together, these data represent about half of the full three-dimensional transform to 3.5 A. The map of the structure has a resolution of 3.5 A in a direction parallel to the membrane plane but lower than this in the perpendicular direction. It shows many features in the density that are resolved from the main density of the seven alpha-helices. We interpret these features as the bulky aromatic side-chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan residues. There is also a very dense feature, which is the beta-ionone ring of the retinal chromophore. Using these bulky side-chains as guide points and taking account of bulges in the helices that indicate smaller side-chains such as leucine, a complete atomic model for bacteriorhodopsin between amino acid residues 8 and 225 has been built. There are 21 amino acid residues, contributed by all seven helices, surrounding the retinal and 26 residues, contributed by five helices, forming the proton pathway or channel. Ten of the amino acid residues in the middle of the proton channel are also part of the retinal binding site. The model also provides a useful basis for consideration of the mechanism of proton pumping and allows a consistent interpretation of a great deal of other experimental data. In particular, the structure suggests that pK changes in the Schiff base must act as the means by which light energy is converted into proton pumping pressure in the channel. Asp96 is on the pathway from the cytoplasm to the Schiff base and Asp85 is on the pathway from the Schiff base to the extracellular surface.},

These achievements were accomplished by overcoming the challenges in sample handling, instrumentation, image processing, and model building. At near-atomic resolution, many detailed structural features can be resolved, such as the turns and deep grooves of helices, strand separation in beta sheets, and densities for loops and bulky amino acid side chains. Such structural data of the cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV), the Epsilon 15 bacteriophage and the GroEL complex have provided valuable constraints for atomic model building using integrative tools, thus significantly enhancing the value of the cryoEM structures. The CPV structure revealed a drastic conformational change from a helix to a beta hairpin associated with RNA packaging and replication, coupling of RNA processing and release, and the long sought-after polyhedrin-binding domain. These latest advances in single-particle cryoEM provide exciting opportunities for the 3D structural determination of viruses and macromolecular complexes that are either too large or too heterogeneous to be investigated by conventional X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods.},

Bacteriorhodopsin is a membrane protein that harvests the energy content from light to transport protons out of the cell against a transmembrane potential. Nango et al. used timeresolved serial femtosecond crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to provide 13 structural snapshots of the conformational changes that occur in the nanoseconds to milliseconds after photoactivation. These changes begin at the active site, propagate toward the extracellular side of the protein, and mediate internal protonation exchanges that achieve proton transport.
Science, this issue p. 1552
Bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a light-driven proton pump and a model membrane transport protein. We used time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography at an x-ray free electron laser to visualize conformational changes in bR from nanoseconds to milliseconds following photoactivation. An initially twisted retinal chromophore displaces a conserved tryptophan residue of transmembrane helix F on the cytoplasmic side of the protein while dislodging a key water molecule on the extracellular side. The resulting cascade of structural changes throughout the protein shows how motions are choreographed as bR transports protons uphill against a transmembrane concentration gradient.

Both structure-based and ligand-based methods identify pharmacophores, as well as shape constraints, and subsequently match these with complementary features embedded into small-molecule topologies. Recently, significant attention has been paid to de novo ligand design in combination with biophysical fragment screening and X-ray structure elucidation. Scaffold hopping has evolved from a niche application of de novo design into a rapidly expanding suite of different software tools, which are used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry.},

	abstract = {Structure-based design has emerged as a new tool in medicinal chemistry. A prerequisite for this new approach is an understanding of the principles of molecular recognition in protein-ligand complexes. If the three-dimensional structure of a given protein is known, this information can be directly exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands. Structure-based ligand design is an iterative approach. First of all, it requires the crystal structure or a model derived from the crystal structure of a closely related homolog of the target protein, preferentially complexed with a ligand. This complex unravels the binding mode and conformation of a ligand under investigation and indicates the essential aspects determining its binding affinity. It is then used to generate new ideas about ways of improving an existing ligand or of developing new alternative bonding skeletons. Computational methods supplemented by molecular graphics are applied to assist this step of hypothesis generation. The features of the protein binding pocket can be translated into queries used for virtual computer screening of large compound libraries or to design novel ligands de novo. These initial proposals must be confirmed experimentally. Subsequently they are optimized toward higher affinity and better selectivity. The latter aspect is of utmost importance in defining and controlling the pharmacological profile of a ligand. A prerequisite to tailoring selectivity by rational design is a detailed understanding of molecular parameters determining selectivity. Taking examples from current drug development programs (HIV proteinase, t-RNA transglycosylase, thymidylate synthase, thrombin and, related serine proteinases), we describe recent advances in lead discovery via computer screening, iterative design, and understanding of selectivity discrimination.},

A three-dimensional data set can be assembled from such images when many copies of the molecule are exposed to the beam one by one in random orientations. We outline a method for structure reconstruction from such a data set in which no independent information is available about the orientation of the images. The basic requirement for reconstruction and/or signal averaging is the ability to tell whether two noisy diffraction patterns represent the same view of the sample or two different views. With this knowledge, averaging techniques can be used to enhance the signal and extend the resolution in a redundant data set. Based on statistical properties of the diffraction pattern, we present an analytical solution to the classification problem. The solution connects the number of incident X-ray photons with the particle size and the achievable resolution. The results are surprising in that they show that classification can be done with less than one photon per pixel in the limiting resolution shell, assuming Poisson-type photon noise in the image. The results can also be used to provide criteria for improvements in other image classification procedures, e.g., those used in electron tomography or diffraction.},

	abstract = {Toward the end of his career, Zewail developed strong interest in fast electron spectroscopy and           imaging, a field to which he made important contributions toward his aim of making           molecular movies free of radiation damage. We therefore compare here the atomistic           mechanisms leading to destruction of protein samples in diffract-and-destroy           experiments for the cases of high-energy electron beam irradiation and X-ray laser pulses. The damage           processes and their time-scales are compared and relevant elastic, inelastic, and           photoelectron cross sections are given. Inelastic mean-free paths for ejected electrons at           very low energies in insulators are compared with the bioparticle size. The dose rate and           structural damage rate for electrons are found to be much lower, allowing longer pulses,           reduced beam           current, and Coulomb interactions for the formation of smaller probes. High-angle             electron             scattering from the nucleus, which has no parallel in the X-ray case, tracks the slowly           moving nuclei during the explosion, just as the gain of the XFEL (X-ray free-electron laser) has           no parallel in the electron case. Despite reduced damage and much larger elastic           scattering cross sections in the electron case, leading to not           dissimilar elastic           scattering rates (when account is taken of the greatly increased           incident XFEL fluence), progress for single-particle electron diffraction is seen to           depend on the effort to reduce emittance growth due to Coulomb interactions, and so allow           formation of intense sub-micron beams no larger than a virus.},

Polarization spectroscopy provides a highly dispersive velocity-selective absolute atomic reference based on frequency-dependent birefringence in an optically pumped atomic gas. The pumping process leads to dominance of the primary closed transition, suppressing closely-spaced subsidiary resonances which reduce the effective capture range for conventional atomic references. The locking signal is based on subtraction of two orthogonal polarization signals, reducing the effect of laser intensity noise to the shot noise limit. We measure noise-limited servo bandwidth comparable to that of a high-finesse optical cavity without the frequency limit or complexity imposed by optical modulation normally associated with high bandwidth laser frequency stabilization. We demonstrate narrowing to 600\&\#x000B1;100 Hz laser linewidth using the beatnote between two similarly locked external cavity diode lasers.},

	shorttitle = {Handbook of {Mathematical} {Functions}},
	abstract = {Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required.In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems.The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places: mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables); exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12); Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2); confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2); hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2); elliptic integrals \{\vphantom{\}}9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions \{\vphantom{\}}3); Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13); combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11); probability functions (ll); scales of notation (6); miscellaneous functions (9); Laplace transforms (2); and others.Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over100 figures illustrate the text.In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem solving, experimentation and field work.

These clocks operate by alternating intervals of atomic interrogation with the ‘dead’ time required for quantum state preparation and readout. This non-continuous interrogation of the atom system results in the Dick effect, an aliasing of frequency noise from the laser interrogating the atomic transition1,2. Despite recent advances in optical clock stability that have been achieved by improving laser coherence, the Dick effect has continually limited the performance of optical clocks. Here we implement a robust solution to overcome this limitation: a zero-dead-time optical clock that is based on the interleaved interrogation of two cold-atom ensembles3. This clock exhibits vanishingly small Dick noise, thereby achieving an unprecedented fractional frequency instability assessed to be for an averaging time τ in seconds. We also consider alternate dual-atom-ensemble schemes to extend laser coherence and reduce the standard quantum limit of clock stability, achieving a spectroscopy line quality factor of Q {\textgreater} 4 × 1015.},
