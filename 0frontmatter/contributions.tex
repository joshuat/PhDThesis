This thesis presents work I was involved with as a member of the Atom Optics group in the School of Physics at the University of Melbourne.
All work described in this thesis was conducted by me, unless mentioned below:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Cold-Atom Electron and Ion Source: The experimental apparatus was designed, constructed, and improved by many members of the group over a number of years.
Some of the members of the group that have worked on the apparatus are
Andrew McCulloch, Dene Murphy, Corey Putkunz, David Sheludko, Sebastian Saliba, Ben Sparkes, Rory Speirs, Richard Taylor, and Daniel Thompson.
\item The results described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:diffraction} built upon work done by Rory Speirs, published in Reference~\cite{speirs_single-shot_2015}, and conducted in collaboration with Rory.
\end{itemize}
