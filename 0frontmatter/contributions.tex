This thesis presents work I was involved with as a member of the Atom Optics group in the School of Physics at the Unisversity of Melbourne.
All work in this thesis was conducted by me, unless mentioned below:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Cold-Atom Electron and Ion Source: The experimental apparatus was designed, contructed, and improved by other members of the group before my research with it began.
Some of the members of the group that have worked on the apparatus are
Andrew McCulloch, Dene Murphy, Corey Putkunz, Robert Scholten, David Sheludko, Sebastian Saliba, Ben Sparkes, Rory Speirs, Richard Taylor, and Daniel Thompson.
\item The high-bandwidth polarisation spectroscopy work described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:polspec} was conducted with much help and advice from Robert Scholten, Ben Sparkes as well as Lincoln Turner from Monash University. Alex Slavec from MOGLabs was also instrumental in this work as he engineered the high-bandwidth modifications for the MOGLabs lasers used.
\item The results described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:diffraction} built on work done by Rory Speirs, published in Reference~\cite{speirs_single-shot_2015}, and conducted with much advice from Rory.
\item The deflectors used to streak the electron beam in Chapter~\ref{chapter:emittance} were supplied a voltage with electronics designed and built by Rory Speirs and the deflector plates were designed by Andrew McCulloch.
\end{itemize}
