\chapter{Cold-Atom Electron and Ion Source}\label{chapter:setup}

The \gls{caeis} at the University of Melbourne is a source of low temperature electrons or rubidium ions with promising potential as a alternative charge particle source.
The \gls{caeis} works by carefully ionising rubidium atoms trapped in a \gls{mot} in order to generate a low temperature plasma which can then be accelerated to form a particle beam.
The apparatus described here is reaching the end of it's useful life, greater understanding of the limitations imposed by this implementation of a \gls{caeis} and the already impressive developments achieved with this source have paved the way for the next generation of \gls{caeis} which is not compatible with the apparatus.
Numerous doctoral students have worked on this system and the design and construction details can be found in their theses~\cite{sheludko_shaped_2010,bell_cold_2011,saliba_cold_2011,mcculloch_generation_2013,murphy_measurement_2017,spiers_electron_2017}.

This chapter provides an overview of the \gls{caeis} and some of the investigations into source stability, source current and beam optimisation.

\section{Description}
In order to generate electrons and ions the University of Melbourne \gls{caeis} begins with a \gls{mot} that is loaded from a Zeeman slower.
The optical and magnetic trapping fields are then extinguised and the ground-state atoms are carefully ionised using a combination of a red excitation laser and a blue ionisation laser.
The charged particles are accelerated by a static electric produced by the accelerators electrodes.
The polarity of the accelerators determines whether the source produces electrons or ions.

When the source is acting as an electron source the it is essential to turn off the \gls{mot} and Zeeman slower magnetic fields before ionisation due to the significant deviation that the fields cause to the electron trajectories.
Ion trajectories are not adversly affected if the fields are left on due to the much higher ion mass.

\section{Properties}

The primary advantage of \glspl{caeis} over alternative sources is the low transverse temperature of the particles produced.
Electrons produced from the sources can have temperatures as low as \unit[10]{K} which is extrememly low when compared to other electron sources such as photocathode sources (\unit[$10^3$-$10^4$]{K}~\cite{claessens_ultracold_2005}).
