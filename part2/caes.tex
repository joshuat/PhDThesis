\chapter{Cold-Atom Electron Source}\label{chapter:setup}

The \gls{caeis} at the University of Melbourne is a source of low temperature electrons or rubidium ions with promising potential as a alternative charge particle source.
The \gls{caeis} works by carefully ionising rubidium atoms trapped in a \gls{mot} in order to generate a low temperature plasma which can then be accelerated to form a particle beam.
The apparatus described here is reaching the end of it's useful life, greater understanding of the limitations imposed by this implementation of a \gls{caeis} and the already impressive developments achieved with this source have paved the way for the next generation of \gls{caeis} which is not compatible with the apparatus.
Numerous doctoral students have worked on this system and the design and construction details can be found in their theses~\cite{sheludko_shaped_2010,bell_cold_2011,saliba_cold_2011,mcculloch_generation_2013,murphy_measurement_2017,spiers_electron_2017}.
