\subsection{Properties}

The primary advantage of \glspl{caeis} over alternative sources is the low transverse temperature of the particles produced.
Electrons produced from the sources can have temperatures as low as \unit[10]{K} which is extrememly low when compared to other electron sources such as photocathode sources (\unit[$10^3$-$10^4$]{K}~\cite{claessens_ultracold_2005}).

Cold

High coherence

Low emittance

Shaping

Reversal of space charge expansion

Ions or electrons

Applicable to any atom that can be trapped.
