\chapter{Ultrafast Electron Diffractive Imaging}\label{chapter:diffraction}

One of the central motivations for \gls{caeis} is their potential use as an electron source for use with ultrafast electron diffractive imaging~\cite{speirs_single-shot_2015,van_der_geer_ultracold_2009}.
If care is taken with the ionization pathways the \glspl{caes} are able to produce ultrafast bunches of cold electrons~\cite{speirs_single-shot_2015,speirs_identification_2017,speirs_electron_2017} and with improvements to the bunch current the next generation of these sources will have the potential to be able to realise single-shot ultrafast diffractive imaging of small biomolecules~\cite{mcculloch_cold_2016}.

Previous results have shown that diffraction from large crystalline samples is possible using traditional crystallographic techniques~\cite{speirs_single-shot_2015} and this chapter describes extensions to the results shown in References~\cite{speirs_single-shot_2015} and \cite{speirs_electron_2017}, namely achieving \emph{single-shot} ultrafast diffractive imaging and the demonstration of diffraction from aluminium by using a additional voltage bias applied to the sample holder to achieve the required beam energy.

\section{Crystallography}

Crystallography refers the the science of diffractive imaging from crystals and has been studied for over \unit[100]{years}, being the subject of the 1915 Nobel prize in physics~\cite{bragg_structure_1913}.
Crystallography has been an highly productive science having produced results such as the structure of DNA~\cite{franklin_structure_1953,dennis_eternal_2003}, and structural determination of biomolecules~\cite{longchamp_how_2015} {\color{red} more references}.
