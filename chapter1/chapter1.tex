\section{Literature Review}

Laser frequency stabilisation is an essential tool for atomic physics experiments, without it experiments such as \gls{bec} and atomic clocks would not be possible.
There are a large number of techniques available for laser frequency stabilisation with numerous advantages and disadvantages among them.

\Gls{ps} is one such technique that will be discussed in detail here.
\Gls{ps} was first described by Wieman and H\"anch in 1976 as: ``a sensitive method of Doppler-free spectroscopy, monitoring the nonlinear interaction of two monochromatic laser beams in an absorbing gas via changes in light polarisation."\cite{wieman_doppler-free_1976}
A detailed discussion of physics of \gls{ps} can be found in section \ref{section:pol_spec_theory}.
