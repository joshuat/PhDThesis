\caption[Heterodyne beatnote for two cat-eye lasers locked with high-bandwidth polarisation spectroscopy.]{Heterodyne beatnote for two cat-eye lasers locked with \gls{ps} and inset is a higher resolution measurement of the centre peak which has a \unit[$-3$]{dB} width (\gls{fwhm}) of \unit[1.2]{kHz} which corresponds to a laser \gls{rms} width of \unit[0.36]{kHz}.
Both figures are 50-shot averages captured with resolution bandwidths of \unit[30]{kHz} and \unit[100]{Hz} and total measurement times of \unit[0.5]{s} and \unit[2]{s} respectively.}

Sometime after the work described in this chapter was summarised and published in Reference~\cite{torrance_sub-kilohertz_2016} MOGLabs was able to supply two identical new cat-eye configuration lasers\footnote{MOGLabs CEL} that use high-bandwidth low-phase-delay in-laser modulation electronics~\cite{thompson_narrow_2012}.
These two lasers were inserted into the experimental setup described in Section~\ref{section:ps_experimental_setup} in place of the previously used \glspl{ecdl}.
These lasers were able to achieve an individual laser \gls{rms} linewidth of \unit[0.36]{kHz} as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:cateye_beatnote}.
An interesting feature of this beatnote is the smaller peak to the left of the main peak which is due to residual amplitude modulation caused by the \gls{aom}.
The modulation from the \gls{aom} is usually hidden under the main peak but the lasers used in this measurement had slightly different lock-points and thus had a small frequency offset.


\section{Conclusion}

The various linewidth measurements for \gls{ps} with high-bandwidth feedback are summarised in Table~\ref{table:linewidths}.
The simplest and most reliable method, two-laser heterodyne, indicates that the laser linewidth achievable with this laser frequency stabilisation technique is \unit[0.6$\pm$0.1]{kHz}, well below previously demonstrated with \gls{ps}.
The difference in linewidth between the cavity one-sided-peak and cavity \gls{psd} integration measurements can be explained by the low-frequency cutoff of the spectrum analyser used in the integration.
The discrepancy between the two-laser heterodyne measurement and the cavity measurements can be attributed to the effects of laser intensity noise on the cavity measurements and the contributions from high-frequency noise which forms the broad `pedestal' visible in the beatnote but does not affect the heterodyne width.

\end{table}

These measurements indicate that \gls{ps} is capable of achieving spectral linewidth previously only reachable with expensive high-finesse optical cavities.
The long-term frequency stability is easily sufficient for many laser cooling experiments and is significantly lower that previously demonstrated with other laser systems and stabilisation techniques.

Further improvements to spectral linewidth could be made if the noise in the \gls{ps} measurement can be decreased and the signal strength increased allowing for lower shot-noise and greater noise suppression.
Drift can be expected to improve with active temperature stabilisation of the atomic gas cells, active laser-power stabilisation into the \gls{ps} setup, and free space propagation rather than the use of optical fibres.

The investigations described in this chapter have advanced the understanding of high-bandwidth absolute laser frequency stabilisation which may prove useful in the complex ionisation processes utilised by the \gls{caeis}, laser spectroscopy and laser cooling applications.
This research was also instrumental in learning how to utilise high-bandwidth for linewidth narrowing which aided MOGLabs in developing new laser electronics for direct modulation of the diode injection current, and a new fast servo controller\footnote{MOGLabs Fast Servo Controller, \unit[40]{MHz} bandwidth.}.
