\section{Conclusion}

The various linewidth measurements for \gls{ps} with high-bandwidth feedback are summarised in Table~\ref{table:linewidths}.
The simplest and most reliable method, two-laser heterodyne, indicates that the laser linewidth achievable with this laser frequency stabilisation technique is \unit[0.6$\pm$0.1]{kHz}, well below previously demonstrated with \gls{ps}.
The difference in linewidth measured with the two cavity methods can be explained by the low-frequency cutoff of the frequency noise integration method, as the spectrum analysers where unable to measure frequency contributions below \unit[24]{Hz}.
The discrepancy between the two-laser heterodyne measurement and the cavity measurements can be attributed to the affects of laser intensity noise on the cavity measurements and the contributions from high-frequency noise which forms the broad `pedestal' visible in the beatnote but does not affect the heterodyne width.

  & Method & RMS Linewidth (kHz) \\ \hline
  (i) & Cavity one-sided peak & \,\,$2.0 \pm 0.5$ \\
  (ii) & Cavity transmission integral & \,\,$1.68 \pm 0.49$ \\
  (iii) & Heterodyne & $0.60\pm0.1$ \\
  (iv) & Long-term drift & \,\,$51$ \\ \hline\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The high-bandwidth feedback system indicates that \gls{ps} is capable of achieving spectral linewidth previously only reachable with expensive high-finesse optical cavities.
The long-term frequency stability is easily sufficient for many laser cooling experiments and is significantly lower that previously demonstrated long term drifts.

Further improvements to spectral linewidth could be improved if the noise in the \gls{ps} measurement can be decreased and the signal strength improved allowing for lower shot-noise and greater noise suppression.
Drift can be expected to improve with active temperature stabilisation of the atomic gas cells, active laser-power stabilisation into the \gls{ps} setup, and free space propagation rather than the use of optical fibres.

\section{Cateye Laser Beatnote}

Sometime after the work described in this chapter was summarised and published in Reference~\cite{torrance_sub-kilohertz_2016} MOGLabs was able to supply two identical new cateye configuration~\cite{thompson_narrow_2012} lasers\footnote{MOGLabs CEL}.
These two lasers were inserted into the experimental setup described in Section~\ref{section:ps_experimental_setup} in place of the \glspl{ecdl}.
These lasers were able to achieve an individual laser \gls{rms} linewidth of \unit[0.36]{kHz} as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:cateye_beatnote}.
An interesting feature of this beatnote is the smaller peak to the left of the main peak which is due to the two lasers not having exactly the same lockpoint and the amplitude modulation caused by the \gls{aom} that frequency shifts one of the laser beam for the heterodyne measurement.
