\section{Polarisation Spectroscopy Performance}
Visible light has frequencies in the THz range which is well beyond the capabilities of modern electronics to directly measure so a number of clever strategies have been developed to measure the spectral quality of laser systems.
The performance of \gls{ps} frequency stabilisation with high-bandwidth feedback has been characterised using a number of methods detailed here.
Spectral linewidth is a useful metric by which stabilisation techniques are compared and it can be considered over a range of timescales with different implications.
Short timescales measurements, less than a second, indicate the narrowness of the frequency spectrum and are useful when considering frequency dependent interactions, such as those with atoms or optical cavities.
Long timescale measurements, minutes to hours, are useful to determine the stability of the laser and its susceptibility to frequency drift and the robustness of the locking scheme.

\subsection{Laser Systems}\label{section:ps_experimental_setup}

The basic layout of the laser system is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:two_laser_setup}.
A number of the measurements described in this chapter required only a single laser however the most reliable method, two-laser heterodyne (see Section~\ref{section:two-laser_heterodyen}), requires two very similar laser systems.
Two almost identical laser systems were constructed for these measurements with the only major difference being the \gls{ecdl} itself, one being a MOGLabs ECD003 and the other a Toptica DL pro.
Both lasers were controlled by MOGLabs laser controllers\footnote{MOGLabs laser controlled with a MOGLabs DLC202 and Toptica laser with a DLC252.} and used high-bandwidth, \unit[14]{MHz}, servo controllers\footnote{NewFocus LB1005, \unit[14]{MHz} bandwidth} to control the high-frequency diode injection current channel (\unit[$>$10]{MHz} bandwidth).
The laser controllers were used as servos to provide the low-frequency feedback to the \gls{ecdl} piezo (\unit[1]{kHz} bandwidth) and slow current channel (\unit[50]{kHz} bandwidth).
To provide flexibility when performing the numerous measurements with different locking techniques the beam from each laser was split in two and coupled into single-mode polarisation-maintaining fibres.
For each laser, one beam also passed through a double-pass \gls{aom} before being coupled into the fibre to provide some frequency control which was useful for both cavity and heterodyne measurements.

\begin{figure}
\center
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{part1/Figs/ps_two_laser.pdf}
\caption[Apparatus used to test the efficacy of polarisation spectroscopy.]{Schematic of the polarisation spectroscopy apparatus used to measure the performance of the high-bandwidth feedback. The beam from the laser passes through an isolator before being split into two beams by a \gls{pbs} and coupled into optical fibres.
One fibre leads to the \gls{ps} setup shown here, the other to the beatnote or cavity measurements via an \gls{aom}.
The \gls{ps} setup consists of a polarisation stabilising Glan-Thompson prism followed by a beam expanding telescope.
The expanded beam is then divided by a \gls{pbs} into a linearly polarised probe and circularly polarised pump which counter-propagate, via a non-polarising 50:50 \gls{bs}, through the magnetically-shielded \unit[15]{cm}-long rubidium gas sample.
The polarisation rotation of the probe beam is then measured by a balanced polarimeter which consists of a $\lambdaup/2$ waveplate, \gls{pbs} and two high-bandwidth photodetectors (Thorlabs PDA10A).}
\label{figure:two_laser_setup}
\end{figure}

In the two near-identical polarisation spectroscopy setups, high quality calcite polarisers where used to stabilise the polarisation of the beam out of the fibre because ambient temperature changes resulted in polarisation changes in the output beam from the fibres, even though polarisation maintaining fibres were used.
Following the calcite a telescope expanded the beams to the size of the apertures in the double-layer mu-metal magnetic shields, \unit[1.5]{cm} diameter.
Expanding the beams reduced transit-broadening and improved the optical pumping within the \unit[7.5]{cm} long rubidium gas cells.
The pump and probe beams had typical powers of \unit[2.4]{mW} and \unit[2.7]{mW} respectively.
High-bandwidth photodetectors\footnote{Thorlabs PDA36A-EC, \unit[150]{MHz} bandwidth} where used in the balanced polarimeter to generate the error signal.

\subsection{Heterodyne Methods}

Heterodyning is a technique, invented by Reginald Fessenden in 1901, which mixes two frequencies to produce a new frequency~\cite{cooper_physics_2001}.
The technique can be used to examine the spectral properties of lasers as the newly produced frequencies can be tailored such that they are easily measurable by photodetectors and spectrum analysers.

Laser frequency spectrum measurements using heterodyne technique are simple to implement with the correct equipment.
The two laser beams are combined such that they co-propagate, requiring some mirrors and a beamsplitter/combiner, and then directed onto a high-bandwidth photodetector.
The signal from the detector can then be fed into a spectrum analyser which will display the power spectral density of the light on the detector.
Laser heterodyne measurements have the added advantage that they are insensitive to laser amplitude noise.

Heterodyne measurements can also be performed with sound waves, in fact this method is used to tune musical instruments as the new frequency produced can be heard as a `beat' or `beatnote'.
The term `beatnote' is also used in general to refer to the signal resulting from a heterodyne measurement.

\subsubsection{Basic Theory}
In the electrical signal context heterodyning involves the `mixing' or multiplying of two signals (e.g. two sine waves) to produce two different signals with frequencies equal to the difference and sum of the original frequencies:
\begin{equation}
\sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(\theta_1-\theta_2) - \frac{1}{2} \cos(\theta_1+\theta_2).
\end{equation}

In the optical context this is achieved due to the interference term accrued when squaring the electric field in order to calculate the intensity detected by the photodetector. The intensity of an electric field is given by:
\begin{equation}
I(t) = \frac{c\epsilon_0}{2}|E|^2.
\end{equation}

For two co-propagating lasers with electric fields $E_{1, 2}$ and angular frequencies $\omega_{1, 2}$ we can write
\begin{equation}
E_{i}(t) = \sin(\omega_{i}t).
\end{equation}
The electric field at the detector, $E_T$, is given by the sum of $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$, and thus the intensity is given by,
\begin{align}
I(t) &= |E_1(t) + E_2(t)|^2\nonumber\\
&= |E_1(t)|^2 + E_1(t)E_2^*(t) + |E_2(t)|^2.
\end{align}
The interference term, $E_1(t)E_2(t)$, allows for the spectral measurements with optical signals as
\begin{align}
E_1(t)E_2(t) &= \sin(\omega_1 t) \sin(\omega_2 t) \notag \\
&= \frac{1}{2} (\cos([\omega_1-\omega_2]t) - \cos([\omega_1+\omega_2]t)), \label{equation:hetero}
\end{align}
and if $\omega_{1,2}$ are appropriately selected then the first term in Equation~\ref{equation:hetero} is measurable.
The difference in frequency ideally should be fairly small, less than a few GHz, which can often be induced on lasers with the same frequency by an \gls{aom} or \gls{eom}.

The equations presented above provide an obviously na\"ive approach as the frequency spread of the lasers is non-zero but gives a sufficient demonstration of the basis of the heterodyne method.
The spectral profile of the heterodyne signal is formed by the convolution of the spectral profiles of the component lasers, thus strategies are required in order to resolve the lineshape of a single laser.
For two near identical lasers with Gaussian lineshape the beatnote width is $2\sqrt{2\log_e2}=2.35$ larger than the lineshape of the individual lasers (see Appendix~\ref{appendix:heterodyne}).

\subsubsection{Frequency Reference}
One method of resolving the lineshape of a single laser is to use a second laser known to have a frequency lineshape much narrower than the laser of interest so that the convolved lineshape is the same as the lineshape of the laser of interest.
This method is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:heterodyne_reference}.

Shown on the right is the spectral lineshapes of the lasers and the heterodyne beatnote (green).}
    \label{figure:heterodyne_reference}
\end{figure}

The initial intention with the experiments described in this chapter was to be able to use a \gls{pdh} locked laser as a frequency reference to characterise the performance of another laser locked with \gls{ps} using high-bandwidth feedback.
Unfortunately, initial measurements were unable to confirm that the \gls{pdh} locked laser was in fact much narrower than \gls{ps} locked laser so more sophisticated methods were required.

\subsubsection{Self-heterodyne}

The self-heterodyne technique involves beating a laser with itself in order to perform a heterodyne measurement, as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:self_heterodyne}~\cite{okoshi_novel_1980}.
In order to perform this measurement it is necessary to split the laser into two beams and frequency shift one beam, usually with an \gls{aom}, such that the beatnote is not centred at DC.
The two beams are still correlated so it is necessary to propagate one beam to reduce the coherence otherwise the lineshape of the beatnote would just appear as a delta function centred at the \gls{aom} frequency~\cite{richter_linewidth_1986}.
The beam is typically delayed by a very long optical fibre ideally such that the beam is delayed for as long as the coherence time of the laser.
Practically this would require optical fibres with lengths from 1 to \unit[100]{km} depending on the linewidth of the laser under investigation.
For example to have minimal coherence between frequency components at \unit[1]{kHz} would require a fibre with a length of \unit[300]{km}.
Unfortunately the absorption losses in fibres tends to be at least a few dB per kilometre making fibres longer than \unit[10]{km} troublesome.
Shorter fibres can be used with more complex analysis, as shown by Reference~\cite{richter_linewidth_1986}.

Shown on the right are the spectral lineshapes of the laser and the heterodyne beatnote (green).}
    \label{figure:self_heterodyne}

\end{figure}

Self-heterodyne was used to measure the performance of \gls{ps}.
Figure~\ref{figure:self-heterodyne_example} shows measurements of a self-heterodyne beatnote from a laser locked with \gls{ps} without high-bandwidth feedback.
The figure shows the beatnote at various ranges and resolutions with the full beatnote, the central portion of the beatnote, and a close up of the central peak.
The centre of the beatnote consists of a central portion with a frequency \gls{fwhm} of \unit[33]{kHz}, an extremely narrow peak with a \gls{fwhm} of \unit[240]{Hz} and an even narrower small peak with a width under \unit[100]{Hz}.
The central portion has a width comparable to the \gls{ps} linewidth reported in Reference~\cite{torii_laser-phase_2012}, \unit[20]{kHz}, and it was unclear whether the central peaks were due to the laser frequency spread or due to the correlated portions of the laser.
Due to this uncertainty it was necessary to perform additional measurements to determine the true linewidth achievable with \gls{ps}.

\subsubsection{Two-Laser Heterodyne}\label{section:two-laser_heterodyen}

Two almost identical laser setups can be used in a heterodyne measurement to determine the lineshape under the assumption that the lineshape of each laser is the same.
This method is very similar to the self-heterodyne technique without the need to consider the coherence between the two beams.
As with self-heterodyne it is necessary to frequency-shift one of the beams with an \gls{aom} such that the beatnote is not centred at DC.
A summary of two-laser heterodyne is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:two-laser_heterodyne}.

\begin{figure}

    \caption[Heterodyne measurement with a two `identical' lasers.]{Heterodyne measurement with two `identical' lasers. One beam is frequency shifted by an \gls{aom} from the initial frequency ($\omega_1$, red) to an offset frequency ($\omega_1+\delta$, blue) to enable measurement by a spectrum analyser. Shown on the right is the spectral lineshapes of the lasers and the heterodyne beatnote (green).}
    \label{figure:two-laser_heterodyne}
\end{figure}

Two-laser heterodyne provides a useful measurement due to its simplicity and the lack of confounding effects (such as those found with self-heterodyne) and thus can provide greater confidence in the results of the measurement.
The downside of this method is the obvious requirement for two very similar lasers frequency stabilised with the same methods.

In order to test the efficacy of high-bandwidth \gls{ps} two similar laser setups were used; both used commercial Littrow configuration lasers, identical optic setups as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:two_laser_setup} with optical fibres that can be connected to the diagnostic measurements such as the heterodyne setup and the high-finesse cavity.

One laser was frequency shifted with a double-pass \gls{aom}, to give a total frequency shift of \unit[160]{MHz}, which was then combined with the other laser with a 50:50 beamsplitter and then incident on the photodetector.
The \unit[1]{GHz} detector\footnote{NewFocus 1621} was connected to a spectrum analyser\footnote{\unit[9]{kHz} to \unit[7]{GHz} Rohde and Schwarz FSP7} to measure the spectrum of the beatnote that was centred around \unit[160]{MHz} due to the frequency shift imposed on one beam of the heterodyne measurement by the \gls{aom}.
An example of a beatnote from two lasers locked with \gls{ps} with high-bandwidth feedback is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:two_laser_beatnote}.
The majority of the optical power is contained within the central peak of the beatnote which, unlike self-heterodyne, can confidently be said to be due only to the frequency spectrum of the lasers.
The central peak has a \unit[$-3$]{dB} width (\gls{fwhm}) of \unit[2.0$\pm$0.4]{kHz}.
As the lasers are uncorrelated and assuming they have identical Gaussian lineshapes indicates that the individual lasers have an \gls{rms} linewidth of \unit[0.6$\pm$0.1]{kHz}.
The `shoulders' of the beatnote at \unit[$\pm$1.5]{MHz} correspond to the servo bump of the fully locked noise spectrum shown in Figure~\ref{figure:psd}.
These measurements indicate that \gls{ps} with high-bandwidth feedback is able to narrow the laser linewidth to \unit[0.6$\pm$0.1]{kHz} which is a significant improvement, by two orders of magnitude, over previously published \gls{ps} performance~\cite{torii_laser-phase_2012}.

\begin{figure}

\caption[Heterodyne beatnote for two external cavity diode lasers locked with high-bandwidth polarisation spectroscopy.]{Heterodyne beatnote for two lasers locked with \gls{ps} and inset is a higher resolution measurement of the centre peak which has a \unit[-3]{dB} width (\gls{fwhm}) of \unit[2.0$\pm$0.36]{kHz} which corresponds to a laser width of \unit[0.6$\pm$0.1]{kHz}.
Both figures are 50-shot averages captured with resolution bandwidths of \unit[30]{kHz} and \unit[100]{Hz} and total measurement times of \unit[0.5]{s} and \unit[2]{s} respectively.}

% Code and data located at Code/PolSpec Code/Laser/Beatnote/Beatnote Inset.py
\end{figure}

The measurement shown in Figure~\ref{figure:two_laser_beatnote} is a 50-shot average with a total measurement time of approximately \unit[2]{seconds}.
Individual measurements, with measurement times around \unit[40]{ms}, had \unit[-3]{dB} widths as low as \unit[880$\pm$280]{Hz}, corresponding to an \gls{rms} laser linewidth of \unit[270$\pm$90]{Hz}.
These measurements show, for the first time, \gls{ps} achieving sub-kilohertz linewidth narrowing, a regime previously relegated to the more complex \gls{pdh}.
\Gls{ps} is able to achieve this low linewidth without the need for modulation or a high-finesse cavity while providing an absolute reference.

\subsection{Cavity Diagnostics}

To confirm the linewidth narrowing results shown by the heterodyne method, we used a high-finesse optical cavity to directly measure the frequency spectrum of a single laser.
Although FM demodulation of the heterodyne beatnote can be used to determine the frequency noise spectrum~\cite{turner_frequency_2002}, wide bandwidth FM demodulation is technically difficult and the results are still a convolution of the noise spectra of two lasers.
A cavity readily provides the noise spectrum for a single laser.
The high-finesse optical cavity used for \gls{pdh} frequency stabilisation provides a useful diagnostic tool for examining laser spectral behaviour.
There are a large number of ways that the cavity can be used to examine the spectral behaviour of a laser system; two that were particularly useful are detailed in this section.

\subsubsection{Cavity Resonance Sweep}

The high-finesse optical cavity provides a useful tool for quickly checking the efficacy of high-bandwidth locking if the cavity linewidth and final laser linewidth are within a few orders of magnitude of each other.
While attempting to lock a laser, the transmission of a portion of the laser beam through the cavity can be monitored.
By sweeping the diagnostic beam frequency incident on the cavity across the cavity resonance, with an \gls{aom}, the laser frequency jitter can be monitored as the bandwidth of the locking scheme is increased.
An example of this process is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:cavity_scans} where the laser is locked with \gls{ps} and the bandwidth of the servo system is varied.
The resulting traces provide a clear illustration of the effect of increased locking bandwidth.
With piezo-only locking the peak appears broad as the laser jitters about the resonant frequency; with slow-current feedback the transmission peak shape becomes apparent.
Finally, with high-bandwidth feedback the transmission function of the cavity is clear with the peak width limited by the cavity finesse indicating that the laser linewidth is much smaller than the cavity linewidth.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{One-Sided Peak Measurements}\label{section:one_sided_peak}

If the linewidth of the laser is lower than that of the optical cavity then the cavity can be used as a frequency discriminator, to convert frequency noise to electrical noise which can then be analysed to determine the laser frequency noise spectrum and linewidth.
As shown in Section~\ref{section:cavity_theory}, the transmission through the cavity, as a function of laser frequency, can be described by an Airy function,
\begin{equation}
T(f) = \frac{1}{1+F\left(\frac{\omega L}{c}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
For a relatively narrow linewidth laser, the frequency of the laser into the cavity can be adjusted (with an \gls{aom} or frequency sidebands with an \gls{eom}) such that the transmission through the cavity is approximately 0.5, thus any deviations in frequency will manifest as a change in the transmission through the cavity.
The variation of the signal measured by the detector can be mapped to the associated variation in frequency using the above equation which can then be used to determine the frequency lineshape as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:side_of_peak}.

\begin{figure}
\center
\input{part1/Figs/SideOfPeak.pgf}
\caption[Laser linewidth measured by examining cavity transmission on one side of the cavity transmission peak.]{Laser linewidth measured by measuring the transmission through the cavity. On the left figure the blue line shows the cavity transmission as the frequency of the beam into the cavity is scanned with an \gls{aom} and the green points show the cavity transmission when the \gls{aom} is used to centre the laser frequency part way up the transmission peak.
The known transmission function (blue line) can be used to map the transmission distribution to a frequency distribution, shown as the green line in the right figure.
The dashed red line is a Gaussian fit to the frequency distribution with an \gls{rms} width of \unit[2.4$\pm$0.3]{kHz}.
The laser used with this measurement was locked with \gls{ps} and high-bandwidth feedback.}
\label{figure:side_of_peak}
% Code and data located at Code/PolSpec Code/Laser/Linewidth Through Cavity/linewidth.py
\end{figure}

The cavity transmission actually includes contributions from both the frequency and amplitude noise of the laser.
An estimate of the linewidth contribution from amplitude noise requires an almost identical measurement without the frequency discrimination provided by the cavity.
By placing the detector in front of the cavity and ensuring the power incident on the cavity is the same as the average power of the cavity transmission measurement, the amplitude noise contribution to the linewidth can be determined.
This measurement indicates that the amplitude noise contribution to the \gls{rms} linewidth was \unit[1.4$\pm$0.2]{kHz}.
The analysis assumes that the frequency and amplitude noise are uncorrelated and that the observed signal is a convolution of the two.
The linewidth determined from the cavity transmission mapping therefore consists of the \unit[1.4$\pm$0.2]{kHz} linewidth amplitude noise convolved with the frequency noise linewidth of \unit[2.0$\pm$0.5]{kHz} to produce the frequency distribution shown in Figure~\ref{figure:side_of_peak}, which has an \gls{rms} width of \unit[2.4$\pm$0.3]{kHz}.

\subsection{Frequency Noise Measurements}

Noise measurements can be useful when attempting to identify frequency-specific noise sources and for determining the bandwidth of frequency locking schemes.
Frequency spectra of the laser can be acquired from the on-resonance \gls{ps} error signal or the cavity transmission signal part way up the Airy peak (similar to that used in Section~\ref{section:one_sided_peak}).
The frequency spectrum of the \gls{ps} error signal provides a measure of the laser frequency noise in combination with the \gls{ps} frequency discrimination, photodetector, and electronic noise and gain.
The measurements shown in this section were generated by stitching frequency spectra measured with a high-bandwidth \gls{rf} spectrum analyser\footnote{\unit[9]{kHz} to \unit[7]{GHz} Rohde and Schwartz FSP7} and a computer-controlled high-dynamic-range audio digitiser\footnote{\unit[24]{Hz} to \unit[100]{kHz} E-Mu E-DSP}.

Figure~\ref{figure:psd} shows a number of frequency noise measurements captured from a laser locked with \gls{ps}.
The \gls{rf} spectrum analyser was calibrated using the slope of the error signal on-resonance, which itself can be calibrated by identifying features in the spectrum such as the \unit[31.5]{MHz} difference between the two rubidium-85 crossovers (see Figure~\ref{figure:satabs}), and the known cavity transmission function as shown in Figure~\ref{figure:side_of_peak}.
The low frequency data were calibrated by matching to the \gls{rf} spectrum data at \unit[10]{kHz}.
The upper portion of the figure shows the frequency spectrum of the \gls{ps} error signal for a range of locking bandwidths from an unlocked laser to one fully locked with high-bandwidth feedback.
Comparing the unlocked spectrum to that of the other spectra allows for an approximation of the bandwidth of that feedback mechanism by finding the intersection with the unlocked spectrum:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Piezo-only feedback has a frequency bandwidth of approximately \unit[1]{kHz}.
    \item Piezo and slow-current feedback has a bandwidth of approximately \unit[50]{kHz}.
    \item Piezo, slow-current and fast-current feedback has a bandwidth of approximately \unit[500]{kHz}.
\end{itemize}
The noise floor of this measurement can be measured by examining the spectrum of the \gls{ps} error signal while the laser is far from the atomic resonance.
The spectrum of the fully locked spectrum is coincident with the noise floor from \unit[450]{Hz} to \unit[350]{kHz} indicating that the servo system is utilising all the signal available in that region.
The frequency of the servo bump at \unit[1.3]{MHz} for the fully-locked spectrum is consistent with phase lag in the laser diode response to injection current modulation~\cite{wieman_using_1991}.

\end{figure}

The high-finesse optical cavity provides another method for examining the frequency noise spectrum of the laser, with a much lower noise floor as shown in the lower plot of Figure~\ref{figure:psd}.
The cavity was used as an independent laser frequency discriminator by shifting the laser frequency with an \gls{aom} such that the transmission through the cavity was half of the peak (similar to the method described in Section~\ref{section:one_sided_peak}) and the spectrum of the transmitted signal was calibrated given the known cavity transmission function.
The noise floor for this measurement was determined by illuminating the photodetector directly with light of intensity equal to that used for the cavity transmission measurement but without the frequency dependent influence of the cavity.
The signal was well above the noise floor for frequencies up to the \unit[5.5]{MHz} bandwidth of the photodetector.
The noise floor for the cavity measurement is significantly lower than that of the error signal measurement and shows that there is significant signal available that could be used if the noise in the \gls{ps} error signal could be lowered.
The three to four orders of magnitude difference in noise floors is consistent with the lower shot-noise in the cavity measurement, once the power conversion by the measurement is taken into account.
The laser power incident on the cavity was \unit[10]{$\muup$W}, compared to the \unit[1]{mW} in the \gls{ps} balanced polarimeter.
Due to the narrow linewidth of the cavity transmission, \unit[71.6]{kHz}, it is not possible to measure the frequency noise of the unlocked, piezo-only or piezo and slow current feedback configurations as the laser linewidth was greater than that of the cavity.

\subsubsection{Noise Integration}

The \gls{psd} of a laser, in \unit[Hz$^2$/Hz], can be described as~\cite{turner_frequency_2002},
\begin{equation}
S(f)=2\int_0^\infty \langle\Delta v(t)\Delta v(t+\tau)\rangle\exp(-i2\pi f \tau)d\tau,
\end{equation}
where $f$ is the Fourier frequency, and $\Delta v (t)$ is the instantaneous frequency of the laser relative to the mean laser frequency.
The \gls{rms} linewidth of the laser is then
\begin{equation}\label{equation:noise_integration}
\Delta v^2_{rms} = \int_0^\infty S(f) df.
\end{equation}

Using Equation~\ref{equation:noise_integration} we can extract a laser linewidth from the \gls{psd} measurements to provide additional confirmation of the other linewidths measurements.
Integrating the \gls{psd} of the fully locked laser, measured with the optical cavity, results in an \gls{rms} linewidth of \unit[1.68$\pm$0.49]{kHz}.

The noise floor can also be integrated to provide an indication of the noise contribution to the linewidth measurement.
For the data shown in Figure~\ref{figure:psd} the noise contributes \unit[0.11$\pm$0.05]{kHz} which is negligible.
The measurements shown have a low frequency cutoff of \unit[24]{Hz} as the spectrum analysers were unable to measure below this point.
The discrepancy between this small noise contribution and the \unit[1.4$\pm$0.2]{kHz} amplitude noise contribution in Section~\ref{section:one_sided_peak} implies that the majority of the noise occurs below \unit[24]{Hz}.

\subsection{Long Term Stability}

Polarisation spectroscopy is inherently a DC technique, susceptible to low frequency drift.
Drift in the laser power output as the laser alignment drifts, variations in fibre coupling efficiency if fibres are used, variations in the atomic vapour density due to changes in temperature, thermal effects on the waveplates and changes to the electronic gains and offsets can all affect the lock point of \gls{ps} due to the resulting intensity noise combined with the difficulty in perfectly balancing the polarimeter.

The high-finesse cavity was used as a reference to quantify the long-term drift of the \gls{ps} locked laser over a period of \unit[60]{hours}, measured every \unit[10]{seconds}, see Figure~\ref{figure:ps_drift}.
Drift in the optical cavity frequency was corrected by reference to the central frequency of a beatnote between a laser locked to the rubidium transition using saturated absorption spectroscopy and the \gls{ps} locked laser incident on the cavity.
The standard deviation of the \gls{ps}-locked laser frequency measurements was \unit[51]{kHz} over the \unit[60]{hour} measurement, approximately half the standard deviation of the measurements in~\cite{tiwari_laser_2006} and significantly smaller than the \unit[400]{kHz} quoted in~\cite{lee_frequency_2014}.
The frequency change between each measurement was on average \unit[5]{Hz}, with a standard deviation of \unit[210]{Hz}.

The frequency stability of \gls{ps} is strongly dependent on the extent to which the apparatus is isolated from ambient temperature variations~\cite{yoshikawa_frequency_2003}.
In our system the lasers are temperature stabilised and isolated with acrylic enclosures, and the optical cavity was temperature controlled and isolated inside a vacuum chamber, but the \gls{ps} and saturated absorption spectroscopy components and optical components between lasers and optical cavity were not temperature controlled or shielded from the general laboratory environment.
The locking stability and drift are expected to improve with environmental isolation of all optical components and temperature stabilisation of the atomic vapour cell.
The power into the \gls{ps} setup is particularly sensitive to polarisation drift in the light exiting the optical fibres.
Although single-mode polarisation maintaining fibres were used, they exhibited significant polarisation drift with laboratory temperature variations, and it is expected that shielded free-space propagation or active power stabilisation of the light into the PS setup would further improve the frequency stability.
